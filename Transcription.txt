99.917 - 104.76: I think that everybody here against the gold standard is planted by the CIA. 108.88 - 110.981:  Oh, this guy had reasonable critiques of Hong Kong. 117.685 - 118.966: What a banger beginning. 119.026 - 122.348: Wow, it's only the positive comments. 124.989 - 129.552: You're the first guy I know that pretends to be an anarchist, but despises activism. 130.487 - 132.108:  Oh yeah, yeah, I'm a real, I'm a real. 132.348 - 140.013: See, you gotta make a difference between cyber information anarchy and real life anarchy. 141.154 - 143.335: Information anarchy, great. 143.515 - 145.116: Crypto anarchy, great. 145.196 - 147.518: Real life anarchy, fuck that shit. 147.538 - 148.118: You know why? 148.138 - 152.36: Because in real life, that's when they pull the gats out. 153.461 - 157.604: In internet, you can just close your eyes, like Tyler the Creator said. 157.964 - 159.545: So, that's what I'm saying. 161.303 - 164.324:  So we can have anarchy, but only on the internet. 164.864 - 168.845: You can't have anarchy in the real world because I live in the real world, okay? 168.865 - 170.405: Does that make, does that be clear? 171.606 - 171.966: Oh yes. 172.586 - 175.146: Love how your POV sounds so naive sometimes. 175.306 - 178.367: That trust feeling of yours regarding interview by Chinese officials. 178.907 - 181.468: I actually really liked this comment. 182.328 - 186.709: Well, this comment, this guy's an idiot, but the trust feeling is definitely one of Georgia's correct takes. 186.869 - 190.13: Unlike the US, China has an actual culture that influences the way everyone acts. 190.65 - 193.572:  That's a gross oversimplification because there's no capturing culture with words. 193.692 - 195.332: Anyway, people aren't defined by politics. 195.372 - 197.714: You have to experience a place first-hand to understand. 198.374 - 202.716: And on this small bit of public trust, George has experience and I'd say he's correct. 203.377 - 210.6: My brother got caught attempting to take a knife onto a bullet train and they simply confiscated the knife, marked the stuff on record, and we were chill all throughout. 211.281 - 214.542: Officials don't really have any animosity. 215.443 - 217.924: And if they do, they don't show it in a friendly and understanding. 219.005 - 219.245: This 222.097 - 225.478:  This is a much better way to put the distinction than I did. 227.419 - 230.22: Um, and then like, you know, he's absolutely right. 230.26 - 232.32: People living in medium trust societies don't get it. 233.301 - 242.924: Uh, I really want to find the one where somebody's talking about, Oh, yeah. 242.944 - 244.264: So George is very smart with COVID. 244.324 - 246.265: It's stupid with politics and people in general. 246.285 - 246.485: Okay. 246.525 - 246.645: So, 247.371 - 248.372:  I mean, I run a company. 248.392 - 249.392: I run two companies. 249.412 - 251.273: I mean, I don't really run a company anymore. 251.294 - 253.675: I mostly, but I do run a tiny court. 254.215 - 258.638: I did found comma and I employ like 30 people. 260.019 - 264.462: So, you know, just, just to have many people do employ, right? 264.502 - 267.904: That's, that's what you always got to remember this about, about haters, right? 268.244 - 275.089: If you want to hate, see, the best thing to do is get a lot of skill and then when you hate on someone, it actually matters. 278.775 - 286.44:  But no, the real one that I wanted to find, uh, you believe the ideal society is one where everyone is rich. 287.321 - 288.382: And that's not the worst thing. 288.802 - 291.644: You genuinely believe it is possible for everyone to be rich. 292.685 - 293.805: Hell yeah, it's possible. 294.286 - 295.647: Let's just all be rich. 297.348 - 303.332: When to be rich, you need to exploit the working class and steal their surplus value. 303.932 - 306.414: Like stop reading Marx's shit. 307.295 - 307.435: What? 308.29 - 309.59:  That's not how it works. 311.851 - 314.592: You being rich, see, and this is the distinction. 316.973 - 319.414: I define being rich in absolutes. 319.774 - 328.677: If you define being rich in relatives, if for you in order to be rich, somebody else has to be poor, somebody else has to be below you, because otherwise, how would you know you're rich? 329.057 - 330.278: You're a terrible person. 330.718 - 336.0: And it's this Girardian resentment that is leading to the downfall of Western society. 337.075 - 338.796:  Because that's not how being rich works. 339.296 - 346.36: Being rich means you got a nice place to live, you got good food, you got nice electronics, life's chill. 347.061 - 348.321: That's what being rich is. 350.082 - 352.323: So yeah, everyone can be rich. 352.884 - 354.945: We can all have nice stuff. 355.877 - 364.844:  We can all have a comfortable life, we can all, yeah, and we don't exploit the working class and steal their surplus value. 364.904 - 370.988: We exploit technology because technology is the best thing ever, right? 371.229 - 371.789: Think about it. 371.969 - 376.333: You used to have to like plant shit in the ground by hand, then we built tractors. 376.913 - 378.434: Is that exploiting the working class? 379.255 - 382.657: Is having a tractor exploiting the working class or is it exploiting nature? 383.805 - 388.529:  We need to exploit this shit out of nature and make everybody super fucking rich. 389.67 - 391.812: You know, that's a nice world, okay? 392.432 - 394.994: But this, it's this, it's this, it's this resentment. 395.375 - 398.497: It's the same thing, it's the same thing we guys talking about about the animosity. 398.757 - 404.062: And that is why the demoralization of Western society is just beginning. 404.082 - 407.244: Cause you gotta get over that. 407.805 - 411.468: And it's gonna take a long time and a lot of grounding people into the dirt. 411.807 - 413.108:  in order for them to get over it. 413.548 - 415.569: We gotta let some people starve in the streets. 416.049 - 419.611: Until there's people starving in the streets, no one's gonna be ready to get over the resentment. 419.831 - 421.272: But these are billionaire! 421.492 - 424.033: You can't have billionaires being our government! 424.793 - 426.454: Okay, okay, you deserve no food. 428.455 - 429.696: George, you can't just say that. 430.977 - 432.157: I can, and I just did. 435.039 - 438.04: Full white supremacist based on Lex Freeman podcast. 438.14 - 438.48: Yikes! 438.881 - 439.181: Yikes! 441.396 - 447.477:  Um, no, but where's the other one that I wanted to talk about? 447.497 - 449.678: Um, yes. 450.578 - 456.26: George is the type of person who has never lived under true oppression or real poverty. 456.28 - 458.6: Uh, and I replied to this guy. 459.42 - 466.802: I replied to this guy because user TD five G Y two F H three P. Where do you live? 469.007 - 470.428:  I'm curious, I'm curious. 471.068 - 481.235: Because I would say that there are a few places in the world where there is true oppression, maybe say North Korea, or real poverty, maybe say South Sudan. 482.796 - 486.259: So there are definitely places where there is true oppression or real poverty. 486.779 - 492.343: But if I find out you live in fucking America and you're talking to me about true oppression and real poverty, 493.263 - 497.126:  Yeah, you want to talk about the type of person who's never lived under true oppression or real poverty? 497.466 - 505.492: If you're truly from one of those countries where they have serious problems in their government, sure. 507.773 - 509.795: But yeah, how old are you and what country are you from? 510.035 - 512.017: It also, it definitely existed in the past, right? 512.037 - 515.919: If you go back to like 1950s China, yeah, we could talk about oppression and poverty. 516.2 - 518.921: You fast forward to 2025 China. 519.122 - 520.403: Yeah, there's no oppression or poverty. 521.884 - 522.404: I mean, you know, 523.294 - 537.886:  There's things to talk about in the west of China, but if you're like, uh, but I don't think this guy lived in China. 539.087 - 541.049: I mean, this guy speaks English. 543.271 - 547.835: So that's what, that's what, you know, where's your, where's your true oppression or real poverty? 548.88 - 550.541:  Are you claiming that you live under that? 551.041 - 553.742: Or are you claiming that you, you read about it in some book? 553.782 - 556.563: You watched some YouTube video about people who are oppressed. 556.964 - 558.304: Yeah, watch that YouTube video. 565.767 - 567.688: Are you still on Hong Kong and salt sheet? 567.728 - 568.809: Why would I insult sheet? 569.269 - 570.449: He's built a nice society. 570.469 - 571.61: That's what I'm saying. 582.357 - 585.118:  I'm not here to agitate because I'll tell you about this. 585.738 - 588.58: Here's, here's, here's, this is like, I don't believe in voice. 589.52 - 594.202: I don't believe that I should come here to Hong Kong and be able to have a voice to change the system. 594.622 - 596.243: I have no right at all to change the system. 597.563 - 599.124: What I do have a right to is exit. 599.844 - 603.686: If I decide that I don't like the system here, I can get on a plane and I can go somewhere else. 604.306 - 605.546: And that's your right in the world. 605.787 - 607.527: I think that's the universal human right. 607.847 - 609.228: The universal human right is exit. 611.303 - 618.845:  If you are, and you can tell this, you can tell this by, those are, you wanna talk about what countries are oppressive. 620.326 - 624.307: The countries that do not let you leave, those countries are oppressive. 631.669 - 637.911: Oppression doesn't mean that you're allowed to, you come into my house and you insult me, you're gonna get thrown out of my house. 638.969 - 640.79:  But you're not going to get held prisoner in my house. 640.81 - 641.931: So there's a big distinction there. 643.372 - 644.993: You're going to be showing the door. 645.733 - 649.115: I show you my nice hospitality and you come in here and you insult me. 649.175 - 650.176: I will show you the door. 651.076 - 654.438: And I think that's, I mean, I think it's happening right now in America. 654.898 - 658.921: If you want to come into America and then start going off and start insulting America, 660.082 - 661.843:  Well, I think there's the door. 662.123 - 669.065: I think all the people who are doing that for America, all the people who are like, I want to live in America and I want to insult it. 670.166 - 671.506: Well, there's the door. 673.867 - 676.088: George, but you insult America in the stream all the time. 676.108 - 677.048: Yeah, and I'm in Hong Kong. 680.53 - 686.432: I'm not saying you shouldn't be able to criticize, but the kind of people who live in America 687.135 - 693.62:  and talk about how America fundamentally is a country founded on slavery or racism or whatever bullshit. 694.061 - 694.501: Come on. 695.342 - 695.702: Come on. 695.982 - 696.543: All right. 696.563 - 697.824: What country would you like to go to? 704.289 - 704.95: Oh, yeah. 705.09 - 705.911: I mean, yeah. 706.291 - 710.194: No, the Ukraine situation is incredibly sad. 710.314 - 713.877: If this person is posting from Ukraine, credit. 721.72 - 722.18:  I doubt it. 729.844 - 731.365: Special economic zone in the US? 731.645 - 733.106: Yeah, but I'll leave it as real power. 733.967 - 737.208: I think you could fix a lot with special economic zones in the US. 738.789 - 743.692: But again, you need real power behind them, like the ones in China. 743.712 - 751.356: Yeah, and you could, like, I mean, 753.9 - 758.782:  I don't know. 758.902 - 768.805: If that's what it comes to, there's a question of how much, how many, like what percent of the people in the US are too far gone down a resentment like rabbit hole. 769.185 - 771.606: What with the demoralization is just beginning. 774.687 - 778.069: You can't exit the US income tax even if you live on Mars, true, true. 778.549 - 779.989: Okay, so let's not spend, 783.729 - 786.851:  I'm a bitter and resentful person who has no valid argument. 795.115 - 796.055: I eat pills, ma'am. 797.236 - 799.337: Oh, how do people eat so many pills every day? 811.103 - 812.184: Well, I think we'll have them. 813.172 - 819.473:  as the US retreats from being a global power is that the US will no longer be able to enforce its global taxation system. 820.853 - 822.834: So they'll be able to enforce it with friendly countries. 823.274 - 830.635: But I think countries like Dubai will say, hey, look, move to Dubai. 831.635 - 835.236: If the US comes looking for taxes, we'll be like, I don't know. 837.596 - 842.097: Is there even enough gold in the world to support the amount of money in circulation? 842.839 - 843.98:  That's a good question. 845.221 - 846.021: Of course there is. 846.441 - 848.083: It's just what we're going to price the gold at. 851.925 - 853.106: Dubai isn't a country. 853.126 - 853.827: I think it is. 853.847 - 855.828: It's an Emirates. 856.148 - 858.45: The UAE Dubai is a city. 859.591 - 860.051: That's true. 862.132 - 862.773: It's an Emirates. 862.893 - 864.454: It's in the same country as Abu Dhabi. 875.192 - 878.875:  How can a small country resist oppression and maintain it sovereignty? 880.356 - 883.719: Well, people forget this about sovereignty. 883.759 - 885.6: Sovereignty is literally just what you have. 886.942 - 889.984: How can a small country resist oppression and maintain it sovereignty? 890.024 - 892.586: Again, it depends on what you mean by oppression. 893.587 - 895.008: Hong Kong used to be a British colony. 895.028 - 897.07: I don't think these people were oppressed by the British. 897.09 - 899.632: I'm not even sure what that would mean. 912.108 - 913.529:  I think about decentralized science. 913.549 - 914.369: Does it have a token? 915.23 - 917.972: If it has a token, it's fucking stupid, okay? 918.572 - 921.174: That's a simple rule. 922.455 - 923.215: Here's a project. 923.836 - 924.756: Does it have a token? 925.797 - 927.158: Yes, stupid. 927.859 - 928.579: That's that simple. 928.599 - 932.822: All right, let's do things. 932.842 - 934.143: Let's not just rant today. 935.351 - 936.594:  That was the opening rant. 937.818 - 941.989: We have a beautiful 90 70 in this computer. 963.009 - 964.37:  I think technically Dubai is not a country. 964.75 - 969.894: I think the UAE is a country because like you can drive to Abu Dhabi and I don't think you have to go through like a border or so. 973.377 - 979.202: Like good you're starting to figure out that there is no like oh this is what makes stuff a country and this is what makes stuff not a country. 980.903 - 984.426: It's just kind of all whatever kind of accepts you blah blah blah blah. 988.763 - 993.384:  If your replacement AMD driver is good, why does the tiny box web shop still lift the driver's mediocre? 993.484 - 995.185: Well, maybe it's time we change that. 995.205 - 995.585: Should we edit it? 995.625 - 999.266: We're gonna edit the tiny, you wanna edit the website? 999.286 - 1000.006: We'll set up the website. 1000.026 - 1006.508: Dun, dun, dun. 1006.848 - 1007.588: Donkey. 1025.335 - 1027.017:  Now, what should we change driver quality? 1031.741 - 1032.462: Developing. 1032.482 - 1036.606: All right, like a developing country. 1036.626 - 1037.386: This is how I'm good. 1041.21 - 1043.312: But no, really, how about this? 1043.572 - 1047.056: What if we just went here and read comments that said good things? 1047.296 - 1048.277: Maybe we'll do that next week. 1048.317 - 1050.439: Maybe we'll only read positive comments. 1057.181 - 1058.942:  Look at how tiny my screen is now. 1058.962 - 1060.003: This is unbelievable. 1060.023 - 1062.805: I don't know how anyone works on a 1080 screen. 1063.546 - 1066.588: It doesn't help that the Mac doesn't have sub-pixel rendering. 1085.942 - 1086.443: Developing. 1105.417 - 1111.222:  I think the website is, I think I made this open now too, so anyone can submit pull requests to it. 1113.924 - 1115.325: Beautiful web dev skills, right? 1116.766 - 1117.226: Thank you. 1117.327 - 1120.109: I used React and compiled it with Babel. 1120.189 - 1123.491: I love that levels I own troll. 1124.252 - 1130.757: We list this super complex stack, and he's like, bro, no, I used PHP and MySQL. 1136.606 - 1138.987:  Don, don, don, don, donkey. 1139.007 - 1163.138: Okay, so I've put the GPU in the hole, and we can see it's in the hole there, but when I do rock em as am I, well, after taking a long time, it tells me this, which someone using these GPUs right now, why is there a percent used? 1170.792 - 1173.934:  There's my VS Code server, okay. 1173.974 - 1174.395: I don't know. 1174.415 - 1177.357: All right, let's upgrade RockM. 1177.577 - 1178.878: Who's ready for this experience? 1180.899 - 1191.407: Or is this even supposed to work for... What RockM do I have? 1200.943 - 1201.203:  3-1. 1202.383 - 1203.644: Is this going to support? 1203.664 - 1209.287: I don't know. 1209.307 - 1209.948: All right. 1209.968 - 1210.768: Should we just yolo it? 1210.808 - 1211.429: Let's yolo it. 1211.469 - 1212.649: Who thinks this is going to just work? 1218.053 - 1218.973: Come on, AMD. 1218.993 - 1220.374: I have faith in you now. 1220.394 - 1221.595: I'm an AMD shell. 1222.695 - 1223.356: What releases this? 1230.602 - 1231.983:  Yeah, we could use dialogue. 1232.003 - 1234.544: We need more dialogue. 1235.645 - 1237.506: We need more open and friendly dialogue. 1238.927 - 1241.349: Install the package maintainer version. 1241.369 - 1247.772: All right. 1247.952 - 1248.233: All right. 1250.074 - 1250.334: Sure. 1250.394 - 1251.895: Download 2.7 gigabytes. 1251.935 - 1253.536: That sounds like a good number of gigabytes. 1255.598 - 1256.639:  What's the goal for today? 1256.679 - 1260.162: Well, we're just going to play with this GPU. 1260.282 - 1262.664: And we're going to see maybe we can get the driver working. 1263.264 - 1266.467: Maybe we can get new matrix cores working. 1266.487 - 1267.628: We'll just see what we can get working. 1271.011 - 1273.753: So AMD released this GPU. 1278.377 - 1282.24: Now, there is a question if we all got majorly rubbed on the price. 1283.317 - 1285.479:  So they announced the price. 1285.839 - 1288.061: This is like the new scam they seem to pull. 1288.621 - 1294.566: They announced the price at $5.99, but you can't actually buy them anywhere for $5.99. 1297.948 - 1298.429: We'll see. 1298.449 - 1301.691: I mean, maybe this will actually go down to $5.99. 1305.514 - 1308.457: And it's because retailers have inflated prices. 1311.643 - 1313.669:  Wait, egregious, what? 1314.532 - 1315.274: I paid 950 for this GPU. 1323.746 - 1326.447:  I mean, I haven't even gotten a 5090 yet. 1326.647 - 1327.508: I have no 5090s. 1327.628 - 1332.05: I have some on order with a large company that promised me they were going to get me some. 1332.47 - 1336.812: And then I think NVIDIA said, you know, we're not putting the tiny boxes in data centers. 1336.852 - 1338.413: The tiny boxes are not for data centers. 1338.473 - 1340.293: It's not the kind of thing you're going to put in a data center. 1340.333 - 1341.534: It doesn't make any sense. 1342.214 - 1347.777: Why would you use Noctua fans if you're going to, like, even the tiny box pro is not really 1348.437 - 1354.378:  I mean, you could maybe put them in data centers, but like, this is the only one we're building with 1590s. 1354.618 - 1355.839: It's not a data center computer. 1356.539 - 1357.599: It is an AI computer. 1358.679 - 1367.061: NVIDIA basically told my understanding is they told all the board makers that you better not sell to AI Fox and you better only sell to gamers. 1368.341 - 1371.082: So considering where AI Fox, we don't get any. 1379.153 - 1382.476:  I'm pretty sure you've talked about it, but what do you think about therapists? 1382.516 - 1386.019: Their tokens per second isn't saying it, and I really want to use them for work. 1387.12 - 1387.98: Well, then use them, bro. 1389.021 - 1389.642: What's stopping you? 1390.422 - 1391.543: What's holding you back? 1394.686 - 1396.327: Is it the Don Don Donky song? 1396.528 - 1405.115: Because... Don Don Don Don... That's gonna take a while to install. 1412.927 - 1416.269:  And we can start with the driver if we want to go crazy. 1416.289 - 1420.511: Do you want to see how far we can get with the driver? 1420.531 - 1430.177: We get like RM mod AMD GPU. 1430.197 - 1433.099: Now let's just let this install and see if it's going to work first. 1437.332 - 1438.673:  Yeah, so play with this GPU. 1438.753 - 1439.354: It's really cool. 1439.454 - 1442.856: AMD releases the instruction set. 1444.818 - 1446.839: So this is the instruction set for that GPU. 1446.879 - 1448.481: You can learn about the whammays. 1448.501 - 1455.766: They have new fancy whammays. 1461.671 - 1463.713: Oh, I didn't show you guys too. 1464.934 - 1466.495: We also have these computers. 1471.186 - 1484.475:  You know what's in here? 1484.615 - 1485.655: 8MI 300Xs. 1486.596 - 1488.938: As we have two of these computers, they were gifts from AMD. 1489.938 - 1492.04: We're working on this stuff too. 1492.06 - 1493.401: Well, this one, this one's a bounty. 1493.421 - 1494.882: UVM is working on it. 1496.703 - 1499.945: Getting the runtime supported with this. 1500.505 - 1509.687:  But we're struggling right now because this GPU is not actually, each one of these is actually eight GPUs. 1510.608 - 1511.948: I'll show you kinda how it works. 1514.869 - 1520.65: So, I guess the kind of shows, yeah. 1522.07 - 1525.351: This is what one of the MI300Xs looks like. 1526.592 - 1528.292: It's like wild, it's a better picture. 1529.388 - 1533.41:  So each one of these is pretty much a GPU. 1535.671 - 1538.573: As you can see, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. 1539.433 - 1544.315: They're all connected with a very high speed interconnect though, and the interconnect speed is faster than memory. 1544.676 - 1550.098: And if the interconnect speed is faster than the memory, in a lot of ways, you can just treat the whole thing as one GPU. 1551.019 - 1554.2: But if I go in here, so there's a tool called UMR, 1555.958 - 1556.698:  Um, it's pretty cool. 1556.778 - 1565.02: UMR is, uh, we like to look into the registers of, uh, it didn't actually like install. 1565.04 - 1566.02: Where is this shit? 1567.24 - 1568.701: This is more than half UMR. 1569.501 - 1570.941: We gotta run that shit with pseudo. 1570.961 - 1576.942: Um, let's see what we can do here. 1578.983 - 1580.123: Let's list the blocks. 1588.157 - 1590.578:  So these are the blocks inside this GPU. 1591.078 - 1598.021: And you can see that there's eight GFX cores. 1599.062 - 1601.263: So let's go back to this computer. 1603.544 - 1605.025: Let's download UMR. 1609.307 - 1611.568: And let's see what blocks are in the new GPU. 1618.732 - 1620.272:  Do you like how big my monitor is now? 1620.312 - 1621.633: Can everybody read the text? 1626.974 - 1628.875: Rockam is not the firmware on the card. 1628.895 - 1630.695: So rockam means many different things. 1632.156 - 1634.717: You guys want a little lesson on how this shit works? 1636.197 - 1637.797: Let's read the tiny grad docs. 1637.857 - 1639.878: I think we kind of talk about it in the docs a little. 1644.699 - 1646.84: So you started the driver. 1648.874 - 1660.48:  The driver is what sits between the hardware and then provides like an abstraction to be able to do things like LK memory, create queues. 1661.481 - 1663.062: You can create these like different queues. 1663.822 - 1666.263: These different queues are like compute queues, SDMA queues. 1666.583 - 1670.365: It brings up the physical hardware to a point that you can start to send commands to it. 1671.246 - 1672.787: Then you have this thing called the runtime. 1673.807 - 1675.629:  I can show you where these things are in TinyGrad. 1675.649 - 1678.171: So TinyGrad has a complete sovereign stack for AMD. 1678.612 - 1683.116: The only non-TinyGrad code that's used at all in the AMD workflow is LLVM. 1684.236 - 1687.499: I think I've talked about this before, but so this is the runtime. 1688.18 - 1690.582: So the runtime includes things like a compute. 1690.982 - 1699.15: Also, the compute queue, the queue itself is created by the driver, but this allows you to actually put things in the queue. 1699.842 - 1701.983:  So this is like putting an exact command in the queue. 1702.023 - 1703.484: You have to set up some registers. 1704.004 - 1706.905: So like these registers include here, we can look here at Leica. 1706.945 - 1710.487: So this is where the local size is was a global size. 1715.309 - 1717.99: So yeah, we put the global size here in the dispatch packet. 1719.751 - 1727.534: The local size is just like the width of the SIMD within the work group processor, but then this global size is like how many of them to do. 1727.594 - 1729.135: And then you send that and then you can 1729.643 - 1732.304:  actually run these commands on the GPU. 1732.344 - 1733.985: And GPUs are really very simple machines. 1734.685 - 1737.326: So this is using what's called PM4. 1737.727 - 1740.068: So AMD has two low-level ways. 1742.128 - 1745.59: There's a thing called the Mac or the Ace. 1745.95 - 1748.951: I know, they use lots of stupid acronyms, but. 1749.892 - 1754.554: So here, we can look at it for the, they have this little document for AMET 300. 1754.594 - 1756.975: So this is actually one of the, what's called an XCD. 1757.848 - 1759.949:  So those four things are called XCDs. 1759.969 - 1765.13: I don't know where that picture went, but there's, sorry, those eight things. 1765.37 - 1767.131: So there's eight of these in the GPU. 1768.812 - 1771.753: These are the compute units where the GPU compute actually happens. 1772.373 - 1779.015: And then these compute accelerators are what reads off of these HQD stands for hardware queue descriptor. 1779.455 - 1785.217: So it reads off these hardware queues, sends them to the hardware scheduler, which actually puts the jobs on the CU of the GPU. 1787.184 - 1791.026:  Wow, you know, you really... This is why these companies use acronyms like this. 1791.186 - 1794.547: AMD and Qualcomm love like tons of acronyms. 1795.828 - 1800.31: Oh, you mean the Ace, you mean the Mac, which is part of the ME, which is overall part of the CP. 1800.37 - 1801.11: Yeah, that's right. 1803.411 - 1805.332: So, yeah. 1806.593 - 1809.874: Yeah, there's eight vertically stacked XCDs. 1811.255 - 1811.535: Yeah, so... 1812.836 - 1816.318:  These packets are parsed by these compute accelerators. 1816.998 - 1822.141: And then these, these, these are just registers on the GPU in the hardware scheduler. 1822.661 - 1827.263: So that'll get the hardware scheduler to actually put jobs on the compute units. 1827.503 - 1829.884: You guys know basically what a GPU looks like, right? 1830.725 - 1837.168: I shouldn't, I shouldn't, if you don't know what a GPU looks like, go, go like, go to like noob college or whatever noobs go. 1839.08 - 1840.902:  So this is the 700X DX. 1841.122 - 1843.724: You can see each of these things, dual compute unit. 1846.206 - 1848.668: Each of these is a shader engine, but not a separate GPU. 1848.728 - 1851.45: I know it looks like a separate GPU, but notice how the L2s are here. 1852.05 - 1853.932: So it's all just levels. 1853.992 - 1855.733: It's all just like different hierarchy. 1856.353 - 1856.994: What is it? 1857.074 - 1858.455: Levels, jerry, levels. 1861.257 - 1861.477: Okay. 1862.418 - 1864.059: So we set it up. 1864.079 - 1864.64: I don't know. 1864.78 - 1867.142: If we reboot the computer, who thinks it won't ever come back? 1868.532 - 1869.493:  Well, please come back. 1869.893 - 1870.513: Oh, yes, come back. 1870.633 - 1871.354: Go ahead, go to computer. 1876.337 - 1878.699: Dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, gee. 1880.4 - 1883.482: And it has 16 SDMA's, so we can bring out that. 1884.143 - 1885.784: Me 200X picture again. 1885.804 - 1890.267: Ah, geez, what is the picture? 1891.287 - 1891.828: It's a picture. 1892.909 - 1894.59: So it has 16 SDMA's. 1895.01 - 1897.192: I haven't looked into this totally yet. 1898.119 - 1902.122:  but I believe that it's two per one of these. 1903.003 - 1910.589: So you can see this is 128 gigabytes per second on the PCIe, but it also has infinity fabric linking it to the other GPUs. 1910.609 - 1917.335: So there's sometimes a picture of that, but it's just, it's a foam actually of a GPU. 1917.355 - 1921.358: So there's seven links out to the other GPUs and then one link back to the host with the PCI express. 1922.719 - 1924.64: So yeah, we're having lots of fun with these. 1927.024 - 1928.985:  And then we also have the RDNA4. 1929.045 - 1932.586: I picked RDNA4 because no one's really working on it externally. 1933.566 - 1936.387: And I think it'll be easier. 1937.107 - 1939.328: There's stuff about this chip that's complex. 1940.849 - 1944.05: RDNA4 might just be literally a simple stuff. 1945.27 - 1946.951: Yeah, so this shows them. 1949.492 - 1950.312: There's the RAM. 1951.722 - 1953.303:  Which one of these is the next CD? 1953.524 - 1955.145: They have 38 compute units each. 1956.486 - 1957.047: You back out? 1959.349 - 1964.954: Go back, go back, go back. 1964.994 - 1967.356: But you know, the GPU market's actually super bleak. 1967.376 - 1969.378: Like I said, I've got my hands on no 5090s yet. 1969.418 - 1976.364: I'm not going to pay some eBay scalper $3,500 for... But the GPUs aren't even ever going to be sold for $2,000. 1976.964 - 1978.606: Like they're all doing the scam now. 1987.443 - 1988.845:  You try vibe coding. 1989.586 - 1991.628: You get, you get, by the way. 1993.951 - 1994.611: I hope, I hope. 1996.462 - 2017.426:  Mr. Peter levels doesn't take insult to when I describe his vibe coded flight simulator as mediocre Because it is a very mediocre flight simulator, but the fact that he's making money off it I love like the indie game down so we're like I spent five years on this game and I worked on every pixel and he doesn't make any money in that this guy makes this bullshit in two weeks. 2017.446 - 2021.787: Yeah based You know you you you don't like 2023.132 - 2031.676:  Like, you gotta think about how to hook people and entertain them. 2032.136 - 2033.897: Well, you know where I got a lot of GPUs? 2033.917 - 2035.938: Does anyone want to buy a tiny box red? 2036.598 - 2038.899: I have a ton of tiny box reds in stock. 2039.519 - 2042.061: Can I interest you when a red the driver is developing now? 2042.681 - 2044.102: Maybe someone will click that buy-by. 2044.122 - 2046.683: Oh no. 2047.863 - 2049.244: It hasn't come back yet, boys. 2052.132 - 2053.473:  It hasn't come back yet. 2056.056 - 2057.317: If it's just gone, it's gone. 2057.337 - 2062.622: I can do some stuff over on this monitor that might try to fix it. 2064.524 - 2067.346: So this is a prototype of a tiny box two. 2068.027 - 2069.788: So it has PCIe 5. 2075.194 - 2077.536: AMD's driver bricked my computer. 2080.053 - 2082.256:  No, I can connect with BMC, hopefully, over here. 2085.841 - 2087.243: No, sales is not above tech. 2087.263 - 2087.984: You guys are idiots. 2088.004 - 2091.409: You guys are missing the whole point. 2091.469 - 2093.252: That actually entirely misses the point. 2093.312 - 2094.394: It's not about sales. 2094.974 - 2096.236: It's the fact that his game 2097.568 - 2100.669:  is a tweet, and I can click a link and I can engage with it. 2100.709 - 2101.57: It's that simple. 2102.19 - 2109.253: Versus, well, I'm not going to sell on Steam because Steam is explaining it to minorities. 2109.633 - 2112.414: I'm only going to sell it on this indie game store. 2112.454 - 2118.197: You can't use credit cards like Visa and MasterCard because they don't allow 2118.69 - 2124.572:  They don't allow the Wikileaks donations to the sex workers or whatever, whatever, whatever. 2124.773 - 2130.655: You gotta use the wall network and buy it through this and then, no, no. 2130.715 - 2133.236: You maybe jump through too many hoops. 2133.776 - 2135.657: That's why Tynograd doesn't have any dependencies. 2135.677 - 2136.938: There's no hoops to jump through. 2137.478 - 2139.919: You just gotta pip install Tynograd. 2139.959 - 2140.859: You can go do that right now. 2140.879 - 2142.38: Who's pip install Tynograd right now? 2146.181 - 2147.663:  User experience over sales. 2148.003 - 2149.825: User experience over everything. 2150.606 - 2151.467: What about the tech? 2151.487 - 2153.129: It's about the user experience. 2157.814 - 2158.916: It's on load taken. 2158.936 - 2159.917: Oh, it's back. 2161.158 - 2162.32: Oh, it has returned. 2162.4 - 2163.481: OK, who thinks it's going to work now? 2165.372 - 2165.572:  Huh? 2165.692 - 2166.492: You think it's gonna be there? 2166.953 - 2167.753: Who thinks it's gonna be there? 2168.353 - 2168.953: Oh, it's there! 2169.073 - 2169.873: Whoa! 2170.134 - 2174.335: Whoa, did we just have a good experience with AMD driver shit? 2174.995 - 2176.456: Why are all of these, like, on? 2177.136 - 2177.796: What are they doing? 2178.156 - 2179.156: Why are you doing something? 2181.617 - 2183.298: All right. 2183.318 - 2186.819: Um, let's try hip equals one. 2196.147 - 2198.13:  I don't know which GPU it's actually targeting. 2198.15 - 2200.493: Is it going to tell me? 2200.513 - 2205.681: It's not going to tell me. 2224.54 - 2228.262:  Okay, the problem is this can actually just be using the. 2228.622 - 2233.624: I don't know if this is using the 79 hundreds or it's using. 2233.684 - 2244.329: How are you going to find that out? 2256.167 - 2258.409:  Oh, let's also try a rock and van with test. 2268.799 - 2271.501: AMD's driver situation has gotten a lot better. 2272.202 - 2274.944: Just overall the fact that you can copy and paste their one thing. 2274.964 - 2279.668: You guys know I'm an AMD investor now, so this has definitely changed my shill calculus. 2279.688 - 2280.409: We now shill. 2281.37 - 2282.451: Oh, look, look at this one. 2282.952 - 2285.513:  Whoa, their PCIe even works pretty well. 2285.873 - 2293.296: So you can see this one's faster because it's, uh, let's just check D message and make sure we're not getting any AERs. 2293.896 - 2294.596: Well, those errors. 2297.678 - 2303.28: Oh, man. 2303.9 - 2304.34: Okay. 2305.12 - 2309.862: Uh, no, apparently, so what we think the issues with the 7900 XTX were, 2312.449 - 2314.71:  We actually think it was a hard work bargain. 2314.77 - 2316.391: That was causing a lot of the issues. 2317.711 - 2320.652: So we have a fix. 2320.692 - 2322.453: Nimble gem put a fix in. 2322.493 - 2332.517: No, more recent than that. 2343.829 - 2361.943:  I think you can see it in the driver. 2366.627 - 2368.168: So hard on this tiny monitor. 2369.289 - 2370.11: Can't see anything. 2381.41 - 2381.81:  Oh, here we go. 2383.712 - 2386.314: This one, turn off on our dispatch. 2386.995 - 2389.217: So there's a flag on the HQD. 2389.277 - 2391.839: You guys should know what that is now called on our dispatch. 2392.8 - 2398.324: And apparently this is what they had to turn on to fix their race condition. 2398.725 - 2404.469: There's probably some hardware issue in the hardware scheduler on RDNA3. 2406.115 - 2409.597:  where you have to turn this on if you're going to dispatch both. 2410.637 - 2412.418: It's possible it's fixable in firmware. 2413.338 - 2418.721: So there's, there's that Mac, which does the things, then there's the ME, which Mac, which does the compute things. 2419.241 - 2423.683: And then there's the, the ME, which does the graphics things. 2424.824 - 2434.308: But yeah, so there's this flag called on or dispatch on, on the PQ. 2439.018 - 2447.18:  Yeah, so I think this is, and it's not actually the mess. 2447.62 - 2449.241: All my complaints were not actually about the mess. 2449.901 - 2451.942: The mess just turns out to be what reports the error. 2454.582 - 2456.123: They did not have any sort of CI. 2457.59 - 2460.572:  Um, as far as I could tell, uh, initially is pushing for it. 2461.372 - 2463.754: Uh, I think I think he sees making progress on that front. 2464.334 - 2465.415: He's talking about the right things. 2465.435 - 2466.536: He's talking about CI. 2466.556 - 2473.64: He's talking about continuous, the updated bills, like nightlies, like just basically normal software stuff that I think AMD kind of lacked. 2474.181 - 2475.642: Uh, but the situation's getting better. 2475.682 - 2476.022: It seems. 2476.462 - 2477.523: So, you know, I'm an investor. 2477.543 - 2481.565: Uh, I've invested a quarter million dollars in AMD. 2481.665 - 2487.169: I put my money where my mouth is, um, because if AMD, like, 2489.507 - 2490.368:  I'm so happy. 2490.388 - 2491.989: I open and I looks like such clowns. 2492.51 - 2502.778: Like they're posting all that stuff where... Ooh, the US and the China and the models and the open source and the... Like, you guys are such clowns. 2503.618 - 2506.0: I hope Sam Altman understands that he destroys company. 2507.361 - 2509.423: Open AI could have stayed open. 2510.304 - 2512.045: They could have easily attracted the money. 2512.445 - 2513.907: There would have been no problems at all. 2514.367 - 2515.548: They could have attracted the money. 2515.908 - 2521.032:  They could have stayed open, they could have commoditized this technology, and Sam Alma would be a hero. 2521.832 - 2523.794: Instead, look what happened. 2525.014 - 2532.52: Opening eyes models are kind of on par, maybe a little better than the competition, but not seriously. 2535.382 - 2537.663: You now got Elon on your ass. 2538.424 - 2539.585: Elon never would have done this. 2541.637 - 2545.719:  So it's, yeah, they're really trying to make it political instead of building an amazing product. 2546.139 - 2548.32: It's going to be interesting to see what happens in deep-seek. 2549.58 - 2559.544: I hope that the Chinese government is chill about deep-seek and understands that the best thing to do is to kind of let them cook. 2559.604 - 2564.946: That's, if your goal is to demoralize the Americans, just let deep-seek cook. 2564.966 - 2565.987: Yeah. 2574.78 - 2588.351:  No, Elon, I watched, I like the, if you guys know Channel 5 news, he had a thing where he went through like what Elon's radicalization was and he says kind of a big moment was the Biden EV Summit. 2589.212 - 2597.859: Biden held an EV Summit where they praised like Mary Barra as the future of electric vehicles and she shipped three cars. 2599.036 - 2605.699:  At this point, I think Elon was just like, holy shit, they're complete idiots and their idiocy is going to bring me down. 2605.719 - 2609.681: He just imagines your Elon. 2609.721 - 2613.802: You're watching this and you're just like, oh my God, these people are retarded. 2614.223 - 2615.563: They're actually retarded. 2615.603 - 2618.945: There's no like, like, oh, because I don't use uni labor. 2619.045 - 2619.265: What? 2621.105 - 2622.046: Joy poverty. 2622.646 - 2627.048: And then Elon looks around and he's like, wait, who am I telling to enjoy poverty? 2628.147 - 2629.248:  I'm the richest guy in this country. 2629.268 - 2630.409: I'm the richest guy in the world. 2630.429 - 2632.31: That's shit. 2632.33 - 2637.914: That sounds like I'm gonna enjoy poverty. 2637.934 - 2640.236: We'll do that. 2640.256 - 2645.359: All right, all right, we're gonna have to do something about this. 2645.539 - 2646.52: I have the government. 2646.58 - 2647.481: How does that work? 2650.644 - 2658.146:  Well, I think you gotta like, if you could have like hearts and minds and you could like control the media and stuff, how much does the media cost? 2659.867 - 2660.687: I'm gonna ask Twitter. 2660.747 - 2662.468: Wait, how much is Twitter? 2665.829 - 2670.49: You see the wheels turning it's at, right? 2671.411 - 2672.311: Yeah, so smart. 2672.411 - 2676.452: Okay, so this obviously is not working. 2676.472 - 2677.532: Why? 2680.115 - 2681.216:  Device node. 2681.317 - 2685.38: Okay, let's add a print statement to hip. 2689.023 - 2689.504: Live. 2689.524 - 2694.188: Okay. 2694.228 - 2694.548: Donkey. 2737.977 - 2739.778:  Okay, so yeah, that's 2769.507 - 2771.269:  And is there a smarter way to figure this out? 2773.511 - 2775.312: First, let's see if we have five. 2781.218 - 2782.92: Well, that's all the same. 2782.94 - 2784.981: It's node three. 2785.021 - 2786.383: So maybe we set it to three. 2786.403 - 2790.186: Or maybe it's two because we have to subtract one. 2790.266 - 2790.687: Who knows? 2798.768 - 2799.388:  Oh, there we go. 2799.869 - 2800.269: Look at that. 2802.37 - 2802.85: We found it. 2803.17 - 2804.431: It's called Device 2. 2807.733 - 2809.394: Let's try some map balls on it. 2833.218 - 2833.999:  That's not going to work. 2834.019 - 2835.26: Sorry, I said two bugger, one. 2847.809 - 2849.13: Five jig of flops. 2850.19 - 2851.732: Well, it's not a lot of jig of flops. 2853.973 - 2856.415: It looks like, oh, we have to go to half if we want to use them anyway. 2861.659 - 2861.739: Oh. 2864.916 - 2865.696:  LVM error. 2870.017 - 2871.918: Okay, okay. 2872.118 - 2872.658: LVM error. 2874.978 - 2876.118: You guys know Don Donkey? 2876.138 - 2886.241: I need a big T. Okay, no luck there. 2887.521 - 2889.121: Let's look into making our runtime work. 2889.141 - 2892.462: It's probably really simple. 2894.868 - 2897.572:  So this is an ops AMD. 2897.592 - 2905.304: That's the same print here. 2957.73 - 2963.535:  Why didn't that print? 2973.084 - 2973.464:  Okay, this. 2974.025 - 2974.285: Okay. 2975.026 - 2977.148: Opening zero with RHDFX guys. 2977.208 - 2981.952: So we can do visible devices equals two. 2983.633 - 2984.574: You don't need to hit visible. 2984.594 - 2988.197: I mean, you can use hit visible devices, but when you're using the, uh, okay. 2988.377 - 2989.978: So that just didn't open at all. 2990.459 - 2992.06: And let's figure out where the R was. 2993.041 - 2993.281: Okay. 2993.702 - 2995.323: Unsupported arch GFX 2021. 2995.363 - 2995.763: So that's 13. 3004.209 - 3004.73:  Wait, no way. 3013.56 - 3014.02: Okay. 3016.984 - 3017.725: Does that just work? 3020.508 - 3022.11: And this might be the easiest shit ever. 3038.934 - 3047.563:  Um, you have the vigipers per, oh, it's like taking a while to save or something. 3054.829 - 3056.031: How come that's already there? 3062.677 - 3063.618: Who put that there? 3065.833 - 3068.956:  Like it's like it's already meant to support this chip. 3073.58 - 3075.182: Did someone like already had support for it? 3075.202 - 3076.463: And all I had to do was change this. 3081.648 - 3082.068: Cool. 3085.011 - 3085.751: Well, yeah, okay. 3085.771 - 3087.093: So I think it just kind of works. 3103.884 - 3107.587:  I mean, the CD and A1 is different, but the RT and A1, I thought, might be, like, dead simple. 3107.727 - 3108.888: And it looks like it kind of was. 3120.977 - 3122.198: It sure looks like it works. 3122.998 - 3124.599: I guess, like, when I run llama or something. 3124.619 - 3129.143: Let's see, like, what's the easiest way to run llama now? 3134.124 - 3135.544:  Do I have like a text way? 3135.564 - 3144.587: Right down on. 3153.25 - 3154.65: That's just sick if that works. 3155.71 - 3157.491: That means it's like stack super portable. 3157.531 - 3158.591: I mean, I guess it should be. 3158.671 - 3160.732: There shouldn't have really been any changes to this stuff. 3165.095 - 3169.24:  Oh, especially once we get, we'll have this stuff so it actually imports from the other files. 3171.362 - 3172.583: Should we try to get the driver to work? 3173.604 - 3175.626: So this is still using the kernel driver from 3198.089 - 3200.751:  Every two seconds run rock me SMI. 3202.892 - 3204.473: Okay, cool. 3208.655 - 3209.095: Question. 3210.436 - 3216.36: Are you running on a 79 hunt? 3225.485 - 3226.546: Got to compile the first time. 3243.527 - 3244.508:  Shouldn't be that slow. 3257.178 - 3257.919: I'm gonna give it time. 3267.106 - 3268.187: I did something not wrong. 3312.859 - 3313.279:  Okay. 3313.959 - 3317.2: Well, that doesn't look right. 3317.22 - 3324.702: Let's see if it works, how do you put on the other GPU? 3328.263 - 3330.603: N-D-N-D-N-D-N-D-N-D-N-D. 3333.564 - 3335.024: What are you working on? 3335.325 - 3337.765: You should know what I'm working on by reading the title. 3338.145 - 3340.066: But you Chris something something? 3340.086 - 3340.946: I have no idea. 3349.727 - 3355.473:  Okay, so it works on this GPU. 3357.334 - 3361.018: Tell me a long boring story. 3376.809 - 3397.303:  Okay, so how come this doesn't work on the new GPU, but it only works on the old GPU, let out a massive EAP, and then the one bumbling first grader and a state of high alert, let out a massive EAP to the bumbling second grader in a state of high alert, and the one bumbling first grader, okay, that's probably, that's probably just brilliant to do with this monoliths. 3397.363 - 3399.705: So, okay, why does it not work on this one? 3400.525 - 3402.667: Let's run some tests and figure it out. 3433.222 - 3435.007:  Yeah, no errors, but it gives a weird response. 3435.107 - 3435.367: I know. 3435.508 - 3437.874: I have a little bit of tea left. 3437.894 - 3438.435: We'll go get it. 3438.796 - 3439.718: Maybe there's a good tea in there. 3439.819 - 3441.443: Ooh, there's a squid game energy drink. 3484.84 - 3486.261:  All right, did any of those tests fail? 3487.803 - 3489.144: One of them, oh I see. 3491.266 - 3492.107: That's okay. 3495.931 - 3497.152: We can look into that problem. 3499.234 - 3500.215: Any other tests fail? 3514.962 - 3516.802:  What do we think change between the guards? 3531.725 - 3540.107: Yeah, we're gonna come out with a tiny box two with, it's written here, I have a mailing list if you're interested in the new tiny box. 3543.466 - 3545.727:  We're going to do a tiny box green V2. 3546.307 - 3548.248: We might be at a stock of the greens forever. 3550.489 - 3555.571: But yeah, tiny box green V2 with 4X59D is going to cost the same as the green V1. 3555.871 - 3561.794: It's going to have a general processor in it to support the PCI-5. 3567.037 - 3567.457: I mean, okay. 3568.498 - 3572.641:  So there's a bunch of ways we can start diving into this, delving, so to say. 3576.124 - 3577.605: How does all those tests pass? 3579.427 - 3581.449: But then I try it with llama and it fails. 3583.49 - 3584.511: This is really the worst. 3587.093 - 3588.995: Probably like one bit of subtle bullshit. 3594.98 - 3596.361: Yeah, clearly broken. 3602.012 - 3603.193:  And the map balls are broken. 3603.633 - 3604.874: Do you guys want to look at the map balls? 3604.894 - 3609.057: Or do you guys want to look at the why the other stuff doesn't work? 3613.821 - 3615.122: Who's more interested in which? 3623.448 - 3626.07: I have a guy coming to work at Tiny who's the expert on 3628.277 - 3631.359:  The memory layout for SDMA changed. 3632.02 - 3634.842: Well, you think like the offsets to these registers changed? 3635.282 - 3641.826: I mean, to be fair, I am importing this, which could be different now. 3650.232 - 3651.353: It could have changed that. 3651.373 - 3653.695: It could have changed a lot of stuff. 3659.128 - 3660.949:  Yeah, this isn't really the right idea. 3661.209 - 3663.19: This should really just wait for the refactor. 3663.21 - 3681.257: UuVN's working on a refactor that's going to support the, uh, the, uh, meet 300x. 3681.917 - 3683.318: Might just be better to wait for that. 3693.328 - 3696.972:  And the GPU Navi 10 doorbell neck ring zero. 3698.314 - 3699.895: It could be something like that. 3705.081 - 3712.269: No, I mean, the fact that only some of the kernels don't work probably has more to do with like this kind of garbage. 3742.199 - 3744.341:  It sure has local memory. 3747.604 - 3752.228: Set default scratch size to 128 bytes per thread. 3753.449 - 3755.971: It could just be like all this stuff that's different. 3756.031 - 3757.972: I wish we knew where this came from. 3757.992 - 3762.396: It's got to be something like this. 3764.017 - 3765.659: Something wrong with the local memory. 3770.957 - 3772.698:  I don't know, I'm gonna just yellow that. 3776.2 - 3779.001: GFX wave size is per SE. 3781.462 - 3783.083: First we gotta find a failing test. 3784.824 - 3786.465: If nothing in ops is gonna fail. 3790.607 - 3793.008: Well, okay, first I have another way to fix this. 3794.009 - 3796.29: Let's just disable that for now. 3800.052 - 3800.112: Aww. 3803.133 - 3804.495:  And how do we do that? 3807.898 - 3812.242: We want to go into the oh, this actually this functionality was just added. 3813.244 - 3815.406: So if I go into the C style render. 3818.589 - 3822.293: Into the AMD renderer. 3864.015 - 3866.716:  Well, at least that doesn't error anymore, but it's not using tens of course. 3868.298 - 3871.359:  Uh, let's go a little, let's put a little gas on them tests. 3872.319 - 3874.16: My test dash and auto. 3875.26 - 3875.5: Go. 3881.682 - 3882.442: Big fail. 3890.904 - 3892.145: Does it pass with the other one? 3894.405 - 3897.246: Is it working parallel or is like 32, like just too crazy? 3899.026 - 3899.746:  No, it fails with that, too. 3899.786 - 3900.346: Okay, never mind. 3900.366 - 3904.687: I don't know why it doesn't work. 3906.928 - 3917.25: Oh, there's probably like some, like, it works with four. 3918.09 - 3919.57: I'm just just some resource limitation. 3919.59 - 3926.812: Okay, so it passes on. 3927.152 - 3927.632: This is the, 3930.622 - 3936.084:  other GPU. 3936.104 - 3936.084: 7900. 3937.985 - 3940.666: Oh yeah, it runs out of SDMA queues to allocate. 3942.226 - 3942.827: That's interesting. 3943.047 - 3946.288: We could probably late allocate the SDMA queues to not have a problem there. 3966.236 - 3968.397:  Got to work back from the kernels that aren't working. 3968.477 - 3969.178: I know. 3969.198 - 3973.821: I guess none of these things are really stressing this shit out of locals. 3973.841 - 3975.762: You got to get to beam if you want to do that. 3975.782 - 3984.728: So I want to improve the tests. 3994.927 - 3996.81:  I always check when I get diff to see what I'm up to. 3996.89 - 4003.679: So you see we disable the Tensor cores, change that, we added some debug prints. 4006.002 - 4007.684: Okay, so all those tests pass. 4009.046 - 4012.19: Let's just triple check to make sure that it's actually hitting the right GPU. 4017.904 - 4020.347:  Let's also try to understand, it'll be fun. 4020.407 - 4023.27: We'll try to understand actually what all those weird numbers mean. 4023.29 - 4025.432: I didn't write them, someone else did. 4025.472 - 4027.154: So they probably understand, but I don't. 4027.174 - 4030.237: It's always good to understand understandings and virtue. 4030.297 - 4030.538: Okay. 4030.978 - 4032.2: I don't know. 4032.28 - 4033.781: Let's go to all the tests and see what we got. 4034.362 - 4035.243: Maybe some tests that fail. 4057.975 - 4058.316:  Okay, good. 4058.336 - 4059.237: We got some failing tests. 4059.457 - 4060.058: Let's see what's failing. 4061.56 - 4062.461: Is there anything interesting? 4062.521 - 4063.222: I think it's bullshit. 4067.868 - 4069.53: No device found for one. 4069.59 - 4070.391: Okay, it's bullshit. 4071.713 - 4073.035: Compile failed? 4089.818 - 4093.8:  Initialization is not supported for shared variables. 4097.101 - 4097.421: Huh? 4100.943 - 4102.644: And it seems unrelated to the GPU. 4102.664 - 4104.665: This just might be like a different thing that I broke. 4112.888 - 4114.469: Okay, let's let all the tests run. 4114.509 - 4117.05: I should let all the tests run in the first place, but I got impatient. 4118.958 - 4124.22:  So it's kind of annoying because in CI, we can't run all the tests. 4125.18 - 4135.144: We only run a limited set on, well, testing on physical hardware is annoying because it's not like it can be in GitHub actions. 4136.024 - 4140.605: So these tests might just be failing on master if you run it on MB hardware. 4143.446 - 4144.947: Unrelated to the fact that it's a new GPU. 4148.411 - 4151.773:  Let's read that code that looks suspicious and it's probably the problem. 4160.678 - 4160.998: Okay. 4161.519 - 4162.839: Um, good. 4162.859 - 4163.82: We got some failures. 4163.84 - 4164.24: That's good. 4164.84 - 4167.422: Uh, so where would that stuff be? 4231.052 - 4232.973:  I'm sure that many tests aren't failing. 4238.818 - 4240.039: Some of those are probably real. 4245.183 - 4246.804: Weak object is going away. 4246.824 - 4249.046: Oh no, where did the weak object go? 4249.066 - 4252.428: Come on, print out the test failed. 4252.508 - 4255.03: Why don't you print out the name of the test that failed in the meantime? 4255.05 - 4258.673: These are all garbage. 4263.779 - 4265.06:  No, none of these are real. 4277.484 - 4278.325: No one tests this. 4280.925 - 4284.027: Oh, this in a way, we should be more aggressive about testing this. 4284.107 - 4288.308: So then when we have these kind of problems, we can look at them. 4290.409 - 4292.81: How am I going to find out which kernel is bad? 4294.623 - 4301.589:  Oh, all right, so first let's get a simpler benchmark failing. 4301.609 - 4314.04: You have some tests here that actually test to make sure if I do benchmark. 4326.717 - 4327.917:  I hate that load's so slow. 4327.957 - 4329.178: It doesn't go into that. 4332.098 - 4333.879: Well, we can clearly see the junk there. 4333.899 - 4337.32: What if I say no opt equals one? 4339.861 - 4341.801: It's probably something around locals. 4344.142 - 4345.502: It's probably pretty subtle. 4351.884 - 4353.824: It's unlikely to have changed. 4354.384 - 4356.425: All that stuff's unlikely to have changed. 4363.225 - 4363.626:  Okay. 4369.111 - 4369.851: That seems real. 4375.296 - 4377.338: I woke up in a car. 4382.663 - 4386.587: It's just some optimization that's bad, probably involving locals. 4388.26 - 4392.163:  Does someone want to write a test that goes through and actually tests? 4392.203 - 4396.065: All right, so here's what I found about asking anybody at AMD. 4396.586 - 4401.089: And that was my mistake. 4402.31 - 4408.734: Let's see if we get the same answer on this GPU. 4408.934 - 4410.695: Don't ask AMD, they don't know. 4411.636 - 4414.958: Or like someone in that company knows, but good luck trying to figure it out. 4416.159 - 4417.02: Asking companies. 4417.622 - 4420.704:  If they have a questions policy, they're just not as direct about it. 4420.724 - 4422.666: They'll just kind of jerk you around if you ask questions. 4423.106 - 4426.649: But hey, they sent us two computers, which is a big step for them. 4431.352 - 4436.356: Okay, is that consistent? 4437.617 - 4439.398: Why is it different on the two GPUs? 4439.418 - 4440.119: That's concerned. 4464.035 - 4471.316:  Let's try gbq2 and see if that one fails to We definitely have tests for this 4490.258 - 4491.679:  Here's the guys at AMD. 4491.719 - 4495.863: Well, okay, they do have all this like dynamic register allocation stuff. 4495.903 - 4499.926: Let's just look through the presentation of our unit four and figure out what they might have changed. 4504.05 - 4513.458: Okay, change the number of compute units, ray tracing shouldn't affect anything. 4513.478 - 4515.98: The tensor course change, we just disabled them. 4516.061 - 4517.382: That should be fine. 4533.307 - 4534.568:  Is it actually a four nanometer chip? 4552.481 - 4553.122: Four nanometer. 4554.282 - 4556.744: In some ways, I'm actually very excited about this GPU. 4557.345 - 4559.866: Imagine putting huge grids of them in a computer. 4560.127 - 4561.308: Imagine having like 56 of these. 4570.045 - 4573.286:  Okay, so what could have, does any of this real? 4574.287 - 4575.107: It's groundbreaking. 4575.127 - 4575.727: That's great. 4575.767 - 4576.087: Thank you. 4578.028 - 4578.588: This is real. 4578.748 - 4580.109: Okay. 4584.73 - 4588.251: I also would not put it past AMD to have bugs in their compiler. 4589.372 - 4592.073: So this, well, we can check it with hip. 4592.533 - 4597.534: We'll check it with hip and that'll let us know if there's, okay. 4597.554 - 4599.315: So GPT-2 works okay. 4600.627 - 4603.568:  It's just mama that doesn't work. 4605.768 - 4606.528: Let's check it with hip. 4610.009 - 4615.271: If it's broken with hip, then, oh, that's wrong. 4617.911 - 4619.952: Let's say hip visible device is equals to. 4622.492 - 4625.073: Actually, let's throw some debug one on there to make sure we're getting the right one. 4633.943 - 4635.204:  Just find the locals guy. 4635.224 - 4645.99: Yeah guys, it's broken with hip. 4648.951 - 4649.512: I didn't do it. 4651.933 - 4656.776: Like, there's probably a bug in there compiler. 4658.557 - 4660.678: Well let's check, let's make sure, let's check hip on the other one. 4671.24 - 4672.001:  Yeah, that one works fine. 4676.764 - 4678.405: Yeah, the compiler probably has bugs. 4682.007 - 4683.088: And it probably has to do it. 4683.148 - 4685.709: So this one is using like small D type stuff. 4687.21 - 4687.49: Yeah. 4692.754 - 4694.695: Is the compiler targeting the right architecture? 4696.196 - 4697.237: Yeah, I'm 4699.401 - 4701.422:  Okay, possible, possible. 4701.522 - 4703.003: Let's check all of that. 4703.023 - 4707.684: I mean, that's okay, okay, okay, hang on. 4707.704 - 4708.865: We'll give them the benefit of the doubt. 4709.925 - 4711.106: Give them the benefit of the doubt. 4711.526 - 4713.807: I'm so happy we have hip so we can check this stuff. 4716.528 - 4719.71: It's possible that I'm not piping the thing through right. 4719.91 - 4721.03: Let's check the arch here. 4725.612 - 4727.633: And then let's also disable the compiler cache. 4737.468 - 4739.648:  Oh, putting in the arch correctly. 4739.668 - 4747.09: All right, let's disable. 4747.15 - 4748.35: Let's try it with O zero. 4748.39 - 4759.573: It's really slow because we're just able to compile a cache. 4761.453 - 4762.093: Oh, perfect. 4762.113 - 4764.834: All right, so we're putting in that correctly. 4768.894 - 4771.355:  Let's go change those to O zero. 4772.055 - 4773.636: Who thinks it's going to work with O zero? 4777.158 - 4777.378: Okay. 4777.518 - 4784.822: Now, before we remember, we're not going to blindly criticize AMD anymore because we are now investors in AMD. 4785.042 - 4786.502: So we now show for AMD. 4786.542 - 4791.705: So I'm sure that their compiler works great and I'm just doing something wrong. 4792.766 - 4792.966: Right? 4793.006 - 4793.506: Do we believe? 4799.559 - 4800.719:  Okay, well. 4800.859 - 4811.542: All right, let's let's sanity check. 4811.682 - 4813.702: Let's go to let's check it on CPU. 4813.722 - 4818.943: So with tiny grads, very easy to run, like the same thing on CPU. 4822.264 - 4824.885: This is just claim. 4825.945 - 4826.785: This is your normal claim. 4829.041 - 4830.502:  Is it targeting the right architecture? 4830.522 - 4839.63: Yeah, I mean, probably possible something else is weird here. 4840.911 - 4847.116: We have a pull request to use LLVM, just use LLVM directly, so we can try that. 4849.017 - 4853.521: But remember, it's a new architecture, so it's very plausible that there's bugs in their LLVM implementation. 4856.143 - 4857.324: So this is running it on the CPU. 4859.308 - 4860.409:  And we'll see if it gives something good. 4863.35 - 4865.251: CPU is always a good place to sanity check. 4870.254 - 4870.734: Hello. 4872.475 - 4874.216: How is that the same as it was in the other one? 4882.36 - 4882.62: Yeah, okay. 4882.9 - 4885.962: So notice this is the one on the, on the RDNA3 GPU. 4887.459 - 4889.28:  And this is the one running locally on the CPU. 4889.3 - 4891.88: So we get the exact same thing out of both of them. 4892.661 - 4893.481: So that's correct. 4895.842 - 4897.502: CPU is faster than I thought, which chip? 4898.663 - 4901.684: It's a nine, one, two, four. 4901.704 - 4902.824: Yeah. 4905.285 - 4906.005: Yeah, it's tiny grid. 4906.025 - 4907.986: I guess tiny grid is really good. 4909.106 - 4910.007: It's not that fast. 4910.067 - 4912.507: I mean, there's some places where it's, OK, so sanity checks. 4912.527 - 4913.768: So it's good on CPU. 4914.288 - 4917.069: It's good on one GPU. 4918.087 - 4928.89:  But it's bad on, I have another reason to think the ARCH stuff is wired up correctly because WowsParrot has tested this stuff extensively on RDNA2 GPUs. 4930.23 - 4939.632: So I think that if there was like a problem passing the ARCH in, if I was loading the wrong co-manager, it should throw an error. 4939.652 - 4942.293: I don't think it's this like hip. 4942.313 - 4945.334: Okay, let's try. 4946.397 - 4950.018:  There's a pull request, which mostly works. 4950.058 - 4951.278: The guy's gotta clean it up. 4951.659 - 4953.099: It's just ugly code. 4957.48 - 4961.402: To use LLVM directly. 4963.262 - 4963.642: I don't know. 4963.722 - 4965.383: I mean, do we even want to waste time with this? 4966.323 - 4967.403: The backend works. 4967.503 - 4970.004: It's just really as far as I can tell. 4970.024 - 4971.165: There's just a bug in the compiler. 4974.286 - 4974.846: Where is it? 4987.744 - 4989.005:  Did this get improved more? 4989.025 - 4991.466: Oh, good. 4991.486 - 4992.026: This guy improved. 4992.066 - 4992.867: Okay, he's improving. 4992.887 - 4993.367: He's improving it. 4993.387 - 4993.707: That's good. 4993.727 - 4996.449: Yeah, this one. 4998.35 - 5000.591: Now, there's been 63 comments on it. 5006.834 - 5015.139: I'm just going to go over here and rebase that shit on master and then we can check it out here and we can see if it works. 5018.635 - 5020.396:  Now there's the conflict you're going to resolve. 5022.597 - 5023.257: Oh, Jesus. 5034.703 - 5035.344: Render. 5035.464 - 5042.107: We're going to read this code. 5045.742 - 5056.07:  I guess I have a Sweeney Todd song. 5057.431 - 5059.852: I tend not to have a Sweeney Todd. 5061.434 - 5063.535: His voice for queer and his eyes as well. 5070.22 - 5072.101: Some 60 comment PR that has a conflict. 5072.161 - 5073.182: Yeah, I know, I know. 5079.445 - 5080.646:  Um, I mean, you know, it's good. 5080.666 - 5080.986: Look at. 5081.006 - 5088.929: Oh, well, we have my own failures here, man. 5088.949 - 5091.79: I don't want to do it by that. 5091.81 - 5093.851: I want to commit that. 5104.815 - 5105.575: Pretty good changes, right? 5111.107 - 5112.594:  Let's check out. 5152.868 - 5156.21:  It's an easy enough branch name to remember. 5156.25 - 5158.972: Let's delete. 5163.295 - 5175.622: Let's check out that. 5177.783 - 5178.764: Hold that. 5187.101 - 5189.262:  They said rock M won't be supported for launch. 5189.342 - 5192.284: Well, yeah, I mean the compiler doesn't work. 5194.525 - 5197.607: So now this should compile with LLVM. 5197.827 - 5201.189: If I do AMD LLVM equals one, I think that's right. 5204.792 - 5205.432: Oh no. 5207.313 - 5209.114: Now I did the rebase. 5209.475 - 5209.875: Wrong. 5219.966 - 5221.546:  Mm, super net. 5223.827 - 5224.787: What's missing arch? 5226.028 - 5228.188: Oh, AMD renderers missing arch. 5230.789 - 5232.509: That's what I did in the rebates wrong. 5232.709 - 5233.389: Okay, that's fine. 5238.831 - 5239.991: No, there's no way that just worked. 5241.391 - 5243.292: Oh, it's AMD underscore LVM. 5243.912 - 5246.273: Of course, there's going to be like six things that it's going to pitch about. 5246.313 - 5246.773: Yeah, there we go. 5246.793 - 5247.813: There's one that pitches about. 5248.756 - 5252.558:  Okay, requires LVM greater than 18. 5252.598 - 5253.258: All right. 5254.399 - 5260.482: Okay, now this is fine exception, but you're supposed to tell me how to fix shit. 5264.483 - 5270.906: You want to do 22 or four install LVM 18 as I go. 5272.847 - 5273.488: That's like this. 5276.27 - 5278.41:  It was an automatic convenience script. 5278.51 - 5279.431: Now we're talking. 5279.471 - 5282.991: I love convenience and I, ah, must be run as rude and whatever. 5283.051 - 5283.391: YOLO. 5291.093 - 5292.613: At least they informed you about it. 5292.693 - 5295.394: No, this is the stupid AMD attitude. 5295.654 - 5301.435: No, you can't just be like, well, technically, technically, technically, I'm gonna punch you in the fucking face. 5302.747 - 5305.248:  Like, no, that's not okay. 5305.588 - 5306.748: Like, you know what would be okay? 5306.888 - 5307.708: Here's what would be okay. 5308.208 - 5313.609: If instead of silently being wrong, they had an assert and LLVM that said, hey, we don't support that yet. 5314.069 - 5316.07: Support coming, here, here's how you can help. 5316.41 - 5317.59: Great, that's okay. 5318.11 - 5320.391: Silent wrong output from your compiler. 5321.671 - 5322.791: Yeesh, bro. 5323.251 - 5324.872: Yeesh, I thought you were an adult. 5325.472 - 5326.472: Okay, good, I think that works now. 5328.45 - 5331.171:  Okay, now we're using LLVM. 5331.931 - 5333.932: Oh, oh, we're gonna fix bugs in LLVM? 5334.172 - 5336.813: Yo, should we, should we contribute to AOV's bullshit? 5337.473 - 5338.253: Maybe we'll think about that. 5340.334 - 5341.374: We will think about it. 5343.995 - 5347.597: Um, I'm attending the tale of Sweeney Todd. 5347.617 - 5354.259: No, no, no, no, no. 5354.599 - 5355.479: Where'd my llama go? 5357.94 - 5358.8:  And my llamas over here. 5360.08 - 5360.261: Is that? 5360.281 - 5367.442: All right, disabled compiler cache. 5367.542 - 5369.663: Don't use hip because hip's not going to work. 5375.544 - 5380.125: So this should be closer to upstream and not using the 5390.057 - 5391.898:  Where is it not calling LLVM in that? 5393.419 - 5395.34: I feel like that didn't actually run with LLVM. 5395.36 - 5398.002: I don't really know why though. 5398.022 - 5403.985: Okay, I called LLVM in that. 5405.826 - 5408.448: AMD underscore LLVM, did I spell it right? 5440.78 - 5442.541:  How come that didn't open LLVM? 5443.901 - 5446.042: I mean, okay, a real simple way to check is we can just. 5447.843 - 5449.484: Studio debug equals four and say. 5450.904 - 5451.725: Okay, it's LLVM. 5451.745 - 5453.465: I don't know why it's not printing that. 5455.646 - 5456.367: Would I just miss it? 5457.46 - 5458.2:  I'll just miss that. 5458.22 - 5461.202: I think you can see that that code is all via. 5464.164 - 5465.044: Oh, okay, now it's working. 5465.084 - 5465.425: I don't know. 5466.405 - 5466.685: Whatever. 5466.705 - 5468.346: I just must have missed it. 5469.567 - 5472.909: Oh, because I probably, it probably only principally bug equals two. 5472.929 - 5474.67: Yeah, okay, that's fine. 5478.892 - 5481.534: I know they say they won't support it, but again, 5482.92 - 5490.387:  Having your compiler be silently wrong is like so deeply, okay, we're getting eyes, even with LVM. 5490.407 - 5492.288: So there's probably a bug in LVM. 5496.252 - 5496.912: What else could it be? 5501.596 - 5503.458: I am not interested in tracking this down. 5504.058 - 5507.421: It probably has to do with like, yeah, like strange D types and LVM. 5511.523 - 5513.704:  And that should build LVM from source. 5516.344 - 5519.685: Oh, I don't like that I just ran the yellow script because now I don't know how to uninstall it. 5523.046 - 5527.827: Just all everything. 5531.068 - 5531.428: Really? 5550.095 - 5552.457:  I wish I would just print which LVM got opened. 5552.477 - 5555.138: I think I have that here. 5555.158 - 5559.281: If you bug level do I have to have to have that? 5559.401 - 5560.142: Okay, three. 5560.162 - 5568.327: Okay. 5569.908 - 5570.048: Wow. 5570.088 - 5571.75: So that installed LVM 19 and LVM 19 has a problem. 5579.317 - 5579.677:  Hmm. 5583.398 - 5587.899: Okay, again, before we go crazy and say it's the compiler. 5602.782 - 5603.802: Did I do anything wrong? 5607.483 - 5608.223: We got to get the LVM. 5610.077 - 5612.259:  Does AMD have their own fork somewhere? 5612.279 - 5613.079: Okay, good point. 5614.86 - 5615.261: Let's see. 5620.484 - 5627.169: RockM AMD LLVM project has not been updated in four years. 5635.066 - 5643.969:  I mean, if we really want to prove it's a compiler bug, and then we can really be like, yo, you guys fucked up, we have to find the compiler bug and fix it. 5644.329 - 5649.01: If you want to criticize somebody, you have to show that you're better than them. 5649.47 - 5650.811: And then you can criticize them. 5651.331 - 5654.972: But if you're just going to criticize, you don't know because you could not be better. 5655.352 - 5656.772: So I think we're going to have to find it. 5656.832 - 5657.793: All right, it was exciting. 5658.033 - 5658.613: Yay! 5696.214 - 5697.555:  Show me the car facts. 5698.656 - 5699.397: Love gang. 5699.497 - 5700.879: I don't want to die here. 5700.979 - 5701.319: Nothing. 5701.379 - 5702.821: Have to do so, baby. 5702.921 - 5704.022: Just lie here. 5704.042 - 5706.425: Isn't that awesome? 5717.045 - 5718.246:  I mean, you get that AMD. 5718.646 - 5720.508: All right. 5721.769 - 5724.311: So why are you going to be like loading the weights? 5725.673 - 5726.293: Oh, OK, good. 5726.734 - 5726.914: Good. 5726.934 - 5728.915: Let's read this guy. 5728.955 - 5732.358: You mean the one of the most famous chip reviewers of all time? 5732.378 - 5740.706: Oh, oh, yeah, this definitely looks like bugs. 5744.777 - 5747.578:  All right, so it's just, I mean, it's just mainline LVM. 5747.658 - 5754.6: All right, let's start by building master, because that's what you do. 5756.801 - 5757.761: Build LVM pretty fast. 5786.847 - 5793.708:  So I will also note that if I do no opt, I get a different answer but still not the correct answer. 5794.228 - 5798.389: But these problems, programs are probably going to be a lot easier to debug. 5800.65 - 5805.731: Oh, I do have some fancy beam search stuff that might just automatically find the issue. 5807.191 - 5810.052: I wish I had a simple way to just check every kernel with the CPU. 5810.072 - 5810.252: Yeah. 5815.685 - 5817.646:  So it's a different answer, but it's also wrong. 5820.926 - 5828.708: I mean, how sick would that be if it was just a simple way to check all the kernels with the CPU and then like tiny grad kind of is the regression test for everybody? 5832.389 - 5833.79: How's my cloning of LVM going? 5834.27 - 5834.61: Not well. 5845.535 - 5848.118:  I mean, it's unlikely to be a different bug, right? 5850.62 - 5855.264: We should also try... I have a different llama I can use. 5855.284 - 5863.051: This should work. 5864.652 - 5868.956: I'd rather be bugging in Clang than all of the M, but that still doesn't tell me much. 5870.517 - 5872.279: Just because I can read Clang easier. 5874.495 - 5875.455:  I don't know. 5875.475 - 5876.036: Is that wrong? 5876.476 - 5877.816: Oh, one of these kernels is just wrong. 5879.577 - 5881.378: We can dump the assembly with sex. 5890.181 - 5899.364: Okay, it looks similar to... No, I know. 5899.384 - 5900.544: We have the arch, right? 5900.845 - 5901.465: I'm setting it right. 5901.685 - 5901.945: Why not? 5915.287 - 5915.607:  Zero. 5922.331 - 5922.611: Okay. 5922.971 - 5928.614: I think, um, let's disable the JIT and let's find which kernel's wrong. 5928.674 - 5931.455: And let's do this at the tiny grad layer because it's going to make my life a lot easier. 5931.475 - 5934.156: Uh, okay. 5934.917 - 5937.218: So where do kernels actually get run? 5939.039 - 5941.54: Where do I fire off the exact items? 5945.258 - 5946.139:  to realize. 5955.604 - 5958.065: So that's going to be step one to find in this book. 5958.085 - 5964.688: We're going to, if you're sending AMD the bill and we find this. 5965.529 - 5967.61: Now they said, look, we've got to be nice to AMD. 5967.63 - 5968.791: They sent me two computers. 5969.411 - 5971.092: They sent me two really nice computers. 5973.761 - 5982.007:  Total value really like I was I was trolling when I was saying it was like 200,000 well like 500,000 so they sent me $500,000 worth of stuff. 5982.047 - 5987.892: I think we can fix this bug for him If we can fix the bug, I don't know I'm now at 50% chance. 5987.912 - 5992.516: It's a bug in the compiler 50% chance at something else 6001.23 - 6003.911:  But okay, let's track it down so we can engine. 6005.952 - 6009.613: This is why I also never want to be an early adopter of technology. 6009.633 - 6013.534: Like this is fine on a stream, but I shouldn't be doing this at work. 6014.854 - 6018.295: Okay, so this is where the schedules actually run. 6018.315 - 6022.016: You see we have these things called EIs. 6023.016 - 6024.557: I'll be so much easier if I could just 6029.07 - 6030.811:  So EI is an exact item. 6031.451 - 6033.152: Can I actually type annotate this? 6033.172 - 6037.214: No, I can't. 6043.837 - 6045.537: So this creates an exact item here. 6045.557 - 6048.599: We have a runner. 6049.979 - 6050.86: We have buffers. 6057.621 - 6059.942:  This schedule now, what device it's on. 6061.642 - 6063.402: Schedule items also have buffers. 6063.422 - 6067.564: Recently a view ops. 6075.025 - 6081.287: It consumes... How does it know what a device it's on? 6096.39 - 6096.77:  TX0. 6097.351 - 6103.013: What's the CTX there? 6103.874 - 6104.354: Oh, the buffs. 6104.394 - 6104.894: OK, fine. 6104.914 - 6106.255: So let's just use the buffers again. 6107.415 - 6110.237: We should just be able to copy the buffers. 6130.107 - 6145.704:  I don't have an easy way to like move a buffer, do I? 6147.245 - 6148.507: That's like create a new one. 6180.535 - 6182.377:  Buffers do copy and copy out. 6183.437 - 6184.198: Yes, they can. 6184.218 - 6188.281: So we can even use it as buffer. 6188.321 - 6193.526: So I should be able to just say copy and be done as buffer. 6193.546 - 6197.969: That's a little item like that. 6199.17 - 6200.111: And then we want to. 6219.394 - 6220.855:  This should just be a feature of tiny grad. 6220.895 - 6222.116: It's actually like super useful. 6222.136 - 6231.243: Okay, so we have the CPU exec item and the GPU exec item, dot run, more of ours. 6232.203 - 6234.865: And I don't care about two updates to add some care about that. 6237.212 - 6239.294:  Okay, great. 6239.574 - 6242.757: So we copy over all the buffers, we create the buffers. 6243.538 - 6245.399: Now let's copy out the buffers. 6247.101 - 6252.606: Cpui.buffsubzero.as buffer. 6260.213 - 6261.294: Let's do that runs first. 6263.16 - 6265.361:  Love gang, I don't wanna die here. 6266.382 - 6267.922: Oh, we gotta allocate the buffer. 6270.683 - 6273.005: Copy in on allocated buffer, what? 6274.145 - 6278.487: Oh, yeah. 6278.507 - 6285.831: I cannot copy in two unallocated buffer. 6286.571 - 6288.132: Oh, we're gonna all get the buffer. 6288.152 - 6289.112: We're gonna all get the buffer. 6289.132 - 6290.253: We're gonna all get the buffer. 6290.293 - 6291.193: We're gonna all get the buffer. 6296.032 - 6297.333:  Light up yellow, thank you. 6297.353 - 6305.419: I have to give it the fucking metadata. 6305.439 - 6307.0: I don't want to give it metadata. 6307.56 - 6308.641: It shouldn't be necessary. 6308.661 - 6322.111: The metadata is just for like printing those things, okay? 6322.131 - 6324.953: So you see we're like running each thing on the GPU and the CPU. 6326.65 - 6328.951:  All right, what does this give me a memory view? 6329.011 - 6329.971: I want a memory view. 6330.051 - 6336.874: It gives me a memory view. 6346.118 - 6346.818: Can we get this? 6346.838 - 6347.878: This is a nice thing. 6347.898 - 6352.44: That's all dealt with at higher levels of tiny grad. 6352.46 - 6354.361: Let's get all these refactoring. 6357.569 - 6357.829:  Um. 6363.153 - 6365.895: Is she like, I want like the thing to be like the D type and stuff. 6367.917 - 6373.021: I'm going to do this in time. 6373.041 - 6373.261: Sorry. 6377.004 - 6379.266: It's self thought data. 6379.346 - 6380.547: Here's a data. 6382.289 - 6383.53: Wait, I just do as buffer. 6386.472 - 6402.282:  All right, that's fine. 6402.342 - 6403.182: You don't have shape. 6405.063 - 6406.364: I take away your shape. 6408.586 - 6411.107: You thought you had a shape. 6411.628 - 6412.308: You do not. 6412.328 - 6415.25: I have taken your shape from you. 6432.683 - 6433.443:  Great memory. 6433.463 - 6434.824: I don't love it. 6436.125 - 6439.846: Oh, I guess sometimes I like a nice way to like not make it be memory. 6439.866 - 6441.307: No, it's just memory. 6441.327 - 6448.91: The number about to list. 6463.823 - 6465.964:  Logang, I don't wanna die here. 6466.044 - 6469.065: Nothing left to do, so baby, just lie here. 6469.085 - 6472.186: You gonna hang? 6474.727 - 6476.208: Okay, those numbers look the same. 6476.248 - 6477.088: That's pretty good, right? 6479.569 - 6481.71: Why is this so egregiously slow? 6481.73 - 6484.611: Oh, it's really just fucking Python lists. 6484.671 - 6486.812: I don't know, just like compare like 100 or whatever. 6491.27 - 6494.651:  What can start the Python list and take 26 years to do it? 6494.671 - 6500.633: Okay, it doesn't look the same. 6500.653 - 6502.554: We're doing pretty good. 6502.914 - 6503.734: Pretty good so far. 6503.774 - 6504.294: Good start. 6504.334 - 6504.955: Good start. 6505.815 - 6507.035: Maybe we should assert their equal. 6507.656 - 6508.416: Oh, those are floats. 6508.456 - 6512.897: We got to use special stuff to assert their equal port. 6513.298 - 6517.719: As a pmp dot testing dot assert. 6519.88 - 6520.38: All close. 6527.095 - 6533.44:  Let's see if you can find the bug. 6533.501 - 6534.421: Let's find the bug. 6538.064 - 6540.746: I've read some guys' book now, readings from nerds, guys. 6552.516 - 6553.957: Oh, big fresh tea. 6557.75 - 6560.572:  So like, what am I going to do when I find the thing? 6560.712 - 6564.614: It's just so small. 6564.634 - 6568.916: Let's see. 6568.956 - 6572.858: Look, so it's running each kernel on the CPU and the AMD. 6581.203 - 6582.844: And taking forever to do it. 6584.084 - 6585.185: Oh, do I have no opt on? 6586.296 - 6586.776:  Oh, we don't need. 6586.916 - 6588.197: Okay, we can get rid of the opt. 6589.077 - 6590.377: It doesn't matter if there's opt. 6599.58 - 6601.46: How many times do you want to say debug equals two? 6602.08 - 6602.84: Don't worry it. 6602.9 - 6603.781: No, it's two. 6607.582 - 6610.122: The T that I recommended, you mean like Hong Kong milk tea? 6611.123 - 6612.143: I got that a little faster. 6617.127 - 6618.047:  We're still streaming. 6618.067 - 6618.147: Yeah. 6621.088 - 6622.369: Is there any large tea? 6624.009 - 6624.689: Like this tea? 6629.191 - 6631.511: There's not any in the fridge. 6631.891 - 6633.532: There's just a squid game energy drink. 6635.272 - 6638.733: Should we tell them about our fans? 6638.753 - 6641.694: They're getting the stock. 6641.734 - 6643.215: Let's not tell them. 6643.275 - 6644.215: Let's just speak in like 6646.732 - 6649.332:  You got the stuff I was, is it, is it used to get a cowloon for? 6649.833 - 6650.033: No. 6650.453 - 6651.233: I got it here. 6651.393 - 6651.693: Oh, yeah. 6651.733 - 6651.933: Yeah. 6651.953 - 6652.113: Okay. 6652.133 - 6652.593: Good to meet you. 6652.673 - 6653.553: Good to meet you. 6653.573 - 6653.893: Thank you. 6653.933 - 6654.713: You're almost done. 6655.293 - 6656.854: You're almost done. 6656.874 - 6659.434: You're almost done. 6659.514 - 6660.054: You're almost done. 6660.554 - 6661.975: You're almost done. 6661.995 - 6662.535: You're almost done. 6662.555 - 6665.435: You're almost done. 6665.455 - 6666.435: You're almost done. 6666.475 - 6667.075: You're almost done. 6667.596 - 6669.136: You're almost done. 6669.176 - 6675.297: You're almost done. 6675.657 - 6676.317: You're almost done. 6677.14 - 6677.56:  I'll get you one. 6682.963 - 6684.583: The pill lady is back. 6684.983 - 6686.244: Hey, hi. 6687.204 - 6688.485: We'll do a little Q&A when I get back. 6689.385 - 6690.646: We're doing Q&As now? 6690.666 - 6691.426: I'm not the pill lady. 6691.726 - 6693.007: I'm not the pill lady. 6693.127 - 6694.267: Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. 6694.287 - 6698.249: I want to- I want to- I want to- Whoa, we can only give them the wrong answers though. 6698.269 - 6701.511: I want to disabuse them of themselves from the pill lady. 6701.631 - 6704.752: Well, my stream only spreads misinformation. 6706.173 - 6708.074:  You can't spread true information. 6708.134 - 6709.974: Don't ever tell them anything about my life. 6710.294 - 6711.675: Go ahead. 6711.695 - 6713.896: No, no, no, but like anything that's even close to my life. 6714.956 - 6717.257: Everything I tell them on stream is completely lost. 6718.097 - 6719.458: Don't worry, they can't hear us. 6719.498 - 6720.518: We're all the way out here. 6723.319 - 6724.079: That's okay. 6724.88 - 6733.823: But if we start telling them to stop blank, you know, where we really are right now, that would really, really wreck the illusion. 6737.758 - 6739.119:  All right, see if we're done. 6739.159 - 6741.701: Do you want anything else? 6742.581 - 6750.166: Okay, I'm going to go to the place down the street and get us some coffee. 6751.387 - 6761.834: Coffee, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. 6769.126 - 6777.872:  Wait, it didn't find a bug yet? 6778.352 - 6779.153: Is it still loading? 6779.193 - 6780.093: What's still loading? 6780.173 - 6780.714: Oh, this sucks. 6781.654 - 6783.075: Maybe we can skip all the loading ones. 6783.095 - 6786.238: I don't know if it's a loading one. 6786.258 - 6788.239: I don't know. 6793.322 - 6794.283: Hot or cold? 6794.363 - 6796.604: If I wanted cold, I would have said so, yeah. 6807.228 - 6813.671:  Every person who lives in San Francisco would be so much happier if they moved here. 6814.531 - 6822.114: Like, let's just take all the good software engineers from San Francisco and move here and leave that city to rot to business losers. 6824.435 - 6825.496: I'm just going to let this run. 6825.516 - 6826.256: I don't know. 6826.376 - 6827.637: And I should really just like skip. 6827.977 - 6828.717: You see what it's doing. 6829.232 - 6831.893:  It's running every kernel on the CPU and the AMD. 6831.933 - 6833.614: Let's see if they're the same. 6833.634 - 6839.477: We're gonna drive to SFO now, move to HK and start drinking tea. 6839.537 - 6840.217: I was drinking tea. 6842.479 - 6844.48: If you watch some of my New York streams, I was drinking tea there. 6850.783 - 6855.525: No, like people who live in, I'm actually also like running it twice here, which I don't have to. 6858.459 - 6866.586:  See, like we made a copy of all the buffers using the low level API. 6867.226 - 6885.522: And then we scheduled it on the CPU, we scheduled it on the GPU, we run it on both, and then we get the power of tiny grad that's expressible in that little thing there is kind of unreal. 6885.999 - 6887.179:  Okay, we're almost done with this. 6887.46 - 6890.681: Let's move on to like the attention kernels, the ones that are actually like baby broken. 6891.921 - 6894.002: Oh, there's a rock M validation suite. 6894.062 - 6896.623: Well, clearly didn't get this bug. 6897.623 - 6899.344: In the meantime, we can play with building LLVM. 6901.544 - 6903.645: How do I build the LLVM project? 6903.945 - 6906.706: Well, the LLVM project that already sounds kind of overwhelming. 6908.447 - 6910.007: Building LLVM. 6911.408 - 6911.988: Oh, it's CMake. 6913.397 - 6917.299:  LLVM only build will require gigabytes of space. 6918.68 - 6920.201: Download and install CMake. 6920.901 - 6922.923: Create a build directory. 6924.744 - 6926.765: Build LLVM. 6928.466 - 6929.326: Build LLVM. 6929.867 - 6933.269: CMake LLVM project. 6935.55 - 6940.133: Does not appear to contain CMake lists? 6950.58 - 6951.921:  where the CMake lists that. 6953.501 - 6954.062: See in here. 6954.082 - 6960.885: All right, we're going to slash LVM in here. 6962.906 - 6963.146: All right. 6965.507 - 6968.988: You need to pass CMake build type. 6969.008 - 6969.769: Okay, debug. 6974.451 - 6974.691: Oh, 6977.557 - 6979.038:  And it doesn't look like a real bug. 6979.118 - 6980.559: After all that, that. 6986.003 - 6987.864: The dog is not the beast. 6991.646 - 6991.967: This one. 6994.008 - 6999.252: So, yeah, how do I like skip all of those kernels? 7000.953 - 7002.774: Like stupid heuristic, can I use? 7002.794 - 7004.235: I don't know. 7006.067 - 7007.709:  Actually, let's just write this properly. 7011.254 - 7018.744: Create a context var here called validate with CPU. 7019.124 - 7020.707: It should actually be a feature that I upstream. 7031.118 - 7035.641:  This is like tiny grad second infrastructure for adding stuff like this. 7036.882 - 7045.728: All right. 7045.928 - 7051.292: Let's just find like real bugs. 7053.593 - 7055.714: Let's go to llama three. 7060.43 - 7064.073:  Then, yes, I'm going to orgs benchmark. 7071.278 - 7074.02: So you can just use this context in time you guys like that. 7074.04 - 7074.941: So let's just do that. 7075.161 - 7075.761: Let's work. 7079.464 - 7081.145: So that's just going to load in normally. 7081.165 - 7084.568: Because my LVM building going. 7084.588 - 7087.53: All right, build files have been written. 7087.73 - 7089.011: Let's just not do that wrong. 7091.115 - 7092.496:  Blah, blah, blah, blah. 7092.556 - 7094.857: After CMake has finished running, you can build. 7099.599 - 7100.98: Maybe we should throw some J's on that bitch. 7101.0 - 7102.341: Okay, it seems like it works. 7104.662 - 7105.743: No, or we're just not. 7105.903 - 7107.103: Oh, I don't know what that was. 7116.668 - 7117.449: Okay, I... 7128.048 - 7139.931:  Well, I mean, they eventually can't be the same if they're giving me different outputs. 7140.011 - 7140.291: What? 7152.193 - 7155.514: So they send me the, so they send me the box and I'm going to buy their shitty stock. 7155.714 - 7155.914: Yeah. 7158.074 - 7161.516:  Again, like either they are really undervalued or in videos overvalued. 7161.536 - 7163.257: There's no other way that this makes sense. 7170.282 - 7171.382: They pass the test, right? 7171.582 - 7172.283: That's what I'm saying. 7172.303 - 7185.591: Okay, for some reason the CPU is now giving me the same wrong answer, which makes me think we like missed the bad kernel, or it's the copies that aren't working. 7187.782 - 7190.244:  Oh, no, but no, that's doing it. 7190.264 - 7192.025: It's using a totally different path on. 7192.285 - 7206.437: Oh, God, I did this all with CPU. 7208.038 - 7213.042: And maybe I was too lenient with my RTOS. 7213.803 - 7215.845: I doubt I didn't look like anything stupid, did I? 7228.923 - 7231.306:  What do you minus three should be fine on both? 7231.326 - 7231.766: I don't know. 7231.806 - 7232.747: Maybe it's not in the first 10. 7232.807 - 7234.488: Let's go to 20. 7234.869 - 7237.051: It's a little bit more. 7237.071 - 7237.051: 20. 7237.171 - 7237.411: Okay. 7237.431 - 7239.253: So it's probably not these like loading things. 7243.136 - 7245.298: I mean, it could be RAM. 7247.74 - 7248.261: Maybe. 7256.755 - 7259.486:  Alright, my odds that this is a compiler bug has gone down. 7314.708 - 7317.39:  Hypothetical, what if Jensen sends me a B200? 7317.41 - 7320.712: Yeah, I'll be excited to add support for it. 7323.673 - 7325.234: Will I add support to our Nvidia runtime? 7325.875 - 7326.795: We'll thank Jensen. 7327.716 - 7333.199: We'll still say we think his stock is overvalued, but wait, wait, wait, wait. 7333.679 - 7334.8: I just saw ones that were different. 7345.562 - 7346.362:  I see things. 7363.391 - 7366.612: That's all those AMD kernels that don't have CPU equivalents. 7367.132 - 7368.013: Where are those running? 7373.794 - 7375.275:  Oh, that's like when I rerun it there. 7375.295 - 7376.535: We actually don't need to do that. 7386.56 - 7393.344: Um, so probably want to pop it off the schedule. 7398.086 - 7399.747: Want that to be consumed. 7399.867 - 7400.967: Yeah, like this. 7412.62 - 7414.942:  Okay, so I don't understand. 7415.443 - 7417.024: We know it works on the CPU. 7417.044 - 7430.298: I can also just copy the middle there. 7442.463 - 7443.624:  Let's copy and return the buffer. 7443.645 - 7446.188: That was cool. 7446.208 - 7457.342: Let's write this in a more tiny, gratic style. 7488.18 - 7488.66:  Thank you. 7491.121 - 7492.281: Did you want to keep it in? 7492.641 - 7492.901: No. 7493.481 - 7495.201: Should I be? 7495.842 - 7497.942: How's it going for you? 7499.422 - 7500.263: What is this? 7500.443 - 7503.883: AMD, the new AMD GPU gives the wrong answer for something. 7504.243 - 7505.964: We're trying to figure out why. 7511.405 - 7512.425: They're mostly working now? 7514.366 - 7515.126: They're mostly working. 7515.746 - 7516.306: That's good. 7518.845 - 7520.372:  Maybe for the other one I should use hip. 7554.283 - 7556.804:  We're slowly building it over here because we didn't throw any J's on it. 7556.824 - 7558.104: Should we give it a little J? 7558.124 - 7564.286: It's a lot of zeros. 7567.748 - 7572.209: Okay, maybe the problem is that we didn't go large enough. 7573.109 - 7574.95: This 20 thing is pretty bad. 7574.97 - 7575.97: Okay, let's do this properly. 7575.99 - 7579.912: So where's my NumPy shit? 7579.992 - 7580.952: I do this in NumPy. 7583.087 - 7586.069:  This kind of, this functionality should move to, yeah. 7587.569 - 7588.53: Yeah, yeah, yeah. 7597.074 - 7602.017: Then we need like from MPD type, true MPD type. 7618.499 - 7620.32:  I hope that's a few times. 7664.348 - 7665.349:  This is like sick function. 7665.369 - 7667.13: I don't have a time to grab one since actually works. 7671.493 - 7675.535: Okay, that seems right. 7675.575 - 7678.197: There's not going to be a. Okay. 7683.381 - 7684.802: And now we're checking the whole buffer. 7688.184 - 7689.825: Now we're not going to throw a single J on it. 7689.845 - 7693.087: We're going to throw a free variable and p is 7698.142 - 7700.365:  Love gang, I don't wanna die here. 7700.425 - 7703.508: Nothing left to do, so baby, just lie here. 7707.753 - 7709.835: Now you gotta limit your J's. 7709.855 - 7711.898: That's too many J's. 7711.918 - 7716.403: That's too many knowin' to say, is that what I'm sayin'? 7750.213 - 7751.434:  I mean, this hasn't hit yet. 7759.26 - 7762.542: We definitely need this functionality in buffer and not in tensor. 7763.503 - 7766.665: I wish I could just trust one of you to tastefully do that. 7767.085 - 7774.43: But if I tell you to do a refactor like this, for some reason you're going to do it tastelessly, like you're going to capitalize the middle you in the word buffer. 7774.55 - 7776.292: And I'm like, are you trolling me with this? 7797.421 - 7802.886:  Okay, then the other things that come to mind are like sub buffer support being broken or something. 7809.291 - 7815.457: It's crazy that both hip and the other things seem to do it in the wrong way. 7819.72 - 7821.102: It's kind of bad crap out. 7838.16 - 7841.862:  And if we want to validate the whole thing with CPU, we can just say that with CPU equals one. 7843.582 - 7845.903: Oh, I'm also saying j is equal to zero. 7845.923 - 7851.366: So we should probably. 7866.377 - 7872.349:  Let's do a few more confirmations that things are broken without this value with CPO. 7900.929 - 7902.17:  No validate with CPO. 7902.19 - 7905.212: We run that here. 7905.232 - 7914.837: And we said CPO equal one here. 7914.857 - 7917.438: Do they have different outputs? 7918.458 - 7919.119: Let's find out. 7928.023 - 7928.904: Oh, coffee's delicious. 7930.011 - 7931.68:  A long night ahead of myself, guys. 7968.374 - 7971.036:  The GPU ones are already done and it printed lots of eyes. 7972.377 - 7976.2: And the CPU one is saying more like, hello, how can I assist you today? 7977.04 - 7977.601: That's right. 7977.641 - 7979.002: How can you assist me today? 7979.042 - 7980.223: Let's ask that question. 7980.863 - 7981.884: Oh, you can provide? 7981.904 - 7983.005: All right, sweet. 7984.346 - 7994.253: So if it's not the kernels that are broken, it could be the copies that are broken. 7997.302 - 8004.366:  So, okay, you see that hip gave me that result and CPU gave me that result. 8007.167 - 8010.049: There's nothing in the hip back end that's like remotely controversial. 8010.109 - 8011.95: It's the simplest back end of tiny grad. 8015.752 - 8022.195: I mean, if that's broken, if hip mem copy is broken, this is synchronous, right? 8025.427 - 8026.569:  But this is the hit back end. 8026.809 - 8027.91: It's literally that simple. 8039.526 - 8043.191: Let's think through my check code and make sure I'm checking the right thing. 8060.129 - 8062.55:  We all need to copy and allocated buffers. 8062.65 - 8064.652: That might make, that'll make things a little faster. 8107.372 - 8107.773:  Thanks for watching! 8221.706 - 8222.567:  Why is that zero? 8222.847 - 8224.148: Well, I guess, because it's not. 8224.168 - 8237.658: I don't know what rock GB is going to get me. 8238.518 - 8244.643: You clearly see at the end of the day, one of them produces this and the other one produces the other thing. 8245.623 - 8247.705: And on one GPU, it does differently. 8248.085 - 8250.307: And you saw also, we can double check that the other 8251.366 - 8252.907:  I'm sure you should probably just check that. 8255.588 - 8270.273: So if I run this on, I mean, again, I'm doing a pretty clear thing that means it's probably, it's got to kind of be some empty bugs somewhere, right? 8271.233 - 8272.634: Or I'm holding it wrong. 8274.695 - 8276.936: So this is just hit visible devices equals one. 8276.976 - 8278.416: So we're using the GFX 1100 instead of the, 8286.922 - 8288.242:  They do use the same compiler. 8291.523 - 8293.883: No, but the LLVM one gave me the same answer too. 8296.984 - 8301.885: Which is another pointer to some, like that puts the arch in in a different way. 8304.625 - 8305.885: This is the answer from the CPU. 8305.985 - 8309.426: Let's look at the answer from this GPU. 8312.126 - 8313.087: This is the 7900XDX, not the new one. 8319.949 - 8321.53:  Hello, how can I assist you today? 8322.191 - 8323.312: Okay, so that works. 8324.312 - 8331.618: Also, it gives a different answer with opt and without opt, which is another crazy thing. 8333.9 - 8338.884: But if all the kernels match, the only other thing besides kernels is copies. 8343.948 - 8345.91: Oh, we can try disabling LRU, Alec. 8347.631 - 8348.612: Possible to that. 8356.172 - 8360.795:  So if there's like some like synchronization bugs, we have an LRU allocator. 8365.338 - 8366.319: We disable that. 8378.767 - 8379.248: LRU. 8382.05 - 8382.59: No LRU. 8390.486 - 8390.626:  Ah! 8393.168 - 8408.857: Got it. 8408.877 - 8411.639: Okay, half the elements don't match in this kernel. 8416.962 - 8419.003: It looks like it's one of them loading the weights. 8421.354 - 8422.714:  Yeah, so that changed nothing. 8422.775 - 8423.895: It's not together, you alligator. 8424.195 - 8425.636: Okay. 8425.656 - 8428.376: I'm like L here. 8428.857 - 8433.178: My percent chance that it's a compiler bug just went up to 70%. 8433.218 - 8438.52: Yeah, we got him. 8440.861 - 8443.562: Got him, tell him we got him. 8443.582 - 8445.282: Oh, Lorraine. 8450.005 - 8451.465:  I don't tell them I got them. 8453.546 - 8455.787: So it looks like half the kernel ran or something. 8455.807 - 8460.168: All right, cool. 8460.268 - 8461.328: That match thing is stupid. 8461.428 - 8462.729: I'm going to write that. 8464.469 - 8467.49: So I want to upstream this feature to make the code look beautiful. 8468.73 - 8469.671: Beautiful code. 8476.393 - 8477.093: Actual. 8492.087 - 8492.827:  Look at that. 8493.627 - 8495.728: Can I just take a minute and look at that beauty? 8498.009 - 8502.09: Think about what it would take to write that kind of feature in a different framework. 8502.75 - 8504.49: Plus I've got AMD stock, that's right. 8504.53 - 8506.731: We're gonna fix the bug and we're gonna pump the stock. 8508.311 - 8510.612: Okay, so it's this one that's broken. 8510.792 - 8513.313: Oh my God, it's one of the weight loading. 8519.934 - 8521.495: It's one of the weight loading kernels. 8526.102 - 8530.284:  Um, show the norm weight. 8538.048 - 8540.049: She almost looks like it's after that. 8545.151 - 8546.512: What is it like there and one? 8546.532 - 8548.693: All right, so that's, that loves the weights and stuff. 8552.855 - 8556.316:  I just don't want to sit around and wait forever while this, uh, I don't want to do it. 8556.336 - 8557.836: Let's just hack it and load the weights backwards. 8558.836 - 8560.156: It should be a one line change, right? 8562.297 - 8563.237: Uh, what do we load the weights? 8567.778 - 8570.998: Embarsment bathrooms on table. 8571.158 - 8572.238: What I had to. 8574.399 - 8581.98: Don't believe me when I tell you it's just what anyone would do. 8585.503 - 8587.303:  Oh, is it calling fix Bf 16? 8587.464 - 8592.125: Is that where this bullshit is? 8596.666 - 8598.526: Uh, it's not old weights. 8601.627 - 8602.007: Load. 8609.769 - 8610.669: Quantized. 8610.689 - 8612.65: I don't know how I've load these in reverse. 8617.633 - 8619.494:  It's just a normal way loader. 8619.754 - 8621.134: And then stay, let's take that. 8636.701 - 8638.081: Just we get to the bad kernel faster. 8645.905 - 8646.285: Brutal. 8655.349 - 8657.45:  Okay, well, good. 8657.491 - 8658.471: It fails right away. 8659.672 - 8661.994: Why is that not printing anything there? 8665.776 - 8666.056: Huh? 8669.279 - 8670.499: I have a lot of questions about this. 8673.562 - 8674.462: That should have printed. 8674.742 - 8677.124: Oh, no, I still have debug equals two on. 8678.665 - 8680.666: So we should have printed with those exact items, ran. 8680.686 - 8681.447: I don't know why it didn't. 8684.823 - 8685.684:  That's not a thing. 8685.704 - 8692.009: Wait, what? 8692.029 - 8697.293: Okay. 8700.955 - 8709.882: Wait, what? 8710.022 - 8711.203: I don't even understand this. 8712.564 - 8713.345: Does it still like work? 8718.458 - 8724.061:  Since I reversed the thing, the copy is failing. 8725.822 - 8733.366: If I don't do update stats, does that... Does that not print? 8733.386 - 8741.431: Oh, yeah, you have to do, you have to do update stats, and yeah, whatever. 8766.299 - 8769.362:  So why is that copying from CPU to CPU? 8770.442 - 8771.804: Oh, because that's like I say. 8771.824 - 8781.772: And you can iterable to iterate. 8783.253 - 8784.774: All right, yeah, just broke stuff one. 8788.657 - 8789.878: Can't just reverse it. 8791.34 - 8791.7: Why not? 8795.613 - 8797.594:  Oh, does it not work? 8823.366 - 8824.867: This looks like a very different bug. 8838.552 - 8841.039:  We also probably shouldn't check. 8885.079 - 8889.223:  Should we yield a schedule item in there and then just add logic to there? 8890.024 - 8890.544: Probably nicer. 8890.644 - 8898.852: I'm going to use that in a whole bunch of places. 8898.892 - 8899.573: That's annoying. 8953.167 - 8954.268:  This backwards thing work. 8967.918 - 8969.419: Looks like it didn't actually go backwards. 8974.283 - 8975.724: Did I get rid of the backwards thing? 8976.925 - 8978.146: What am I backwards thing? 8980.367 - 8981.048: Did I get rid of it? 8983.568 - 8984.409:  You guys been watching me? 8984.429 - 8985.149: Did I get rid of it? 8991.054 - 8991.874: That should work, right? 9009.488 - 9010.989: Well, for excess, that's fine. 9012.637 - 9013.057:  Okay, great. 9013.157 - 9013.297: Good. 9013.317 - 9014.437: We're getting to the problem fast. 9016.018 - 9016.358: Okay. 9037.403 - 9038.844: You want a supported kernel? 9038.864 - 9039.964: This isn't the kernel. 9040.7 - 9045.844:  Let's look at, let's look at, well, this is this kernel, but you gotta, you know, kernel is an overloaded word. 9045.884 - 9046.804: It means lots of things. 9046.824 - 9047.625: You want some popcorn? 9047.645 - 9059.573: All right, so I believe that this is the broken code. 9059.593 - 9069.059: I don't know why those are RIDX. 9077.035 - 9079.277:  Oh, could it be because this number is big? 9079.297 - 9082.88: Well, that'd be stupid. 9088.424 - 9089.906: No, it's not even that big on there. 9089.946 - 9091.187: That's a fine number. 9094.129 - 9096.591: OK, this kernel didn't match this kernel. 9100.274 - 9103.237: Let's leave that up here because that's good quality shit. 9104.52 - 9106.502:  Oh, I love that validate with CPU. 9106.562 - 9107.783: Oh, we caught something. 9108.623 - 9109.985: We caught a fish. 9112.226 - 9118.491: How come fish never catch people? 9118.511 - 9119.172: Think about that? 9119.192 - 9120.453: They do. 9120.473 - 9121.374: They're called sharks. 9154.564 - 9159.547:  Because I need someone to talk to because I'm not a human being, part two. 9159.587 - 9164.649: Wait, what? 9165.99 - 9168.871: Okay. 9168.891 - 9171.553: Uh, could it have to do with the big? 9182.532 - 9184.673:  You're almost like it does have to do with the big shit. 9184.693 - 9193.157: I mean, hip should assert if that's a problem. 9193.177 - 9206.982: Oh, I mean, okay, it's possible that it's still a compiler issue. 9209.764 - 9210.304: Interesting. 9219.078 - 9221.42:  So it looks like it only did one eighth of them. 9223.141 - 9224.483: So what's that divided by eight? 9226.224 - 9228.066: Might not be a compiler issue. 9229.307 - 9234.03: It looks like it just only supports 128,000 on that second dimension. 9235.412 - 9237.774: But the other hip has no problems with this. 9237.814 - 9239.875: Let's just do another run over here. 9240.796 - 9244.439: Make sure that we're good if we set the visible devices to one. 9250.842 - 9254.704:  It's possible that this global size is too large for some reason. 9255.825 - 9257.306: That's what I'm leaning towards now. 9259.687 - 9261.748: Because I really doubt that kernel's broken. 9262.109 - 9263.87: I really doubt that's a compiler bug. 9266.431 - 9268.532: We're nowhere near integer limits. 9271.194 - 9271.694: Wait, are we? 9278.278 - 9279.539: Could be near integer limits. 9284.105 - 9285.946:  That same kernel we're going to find over there. 9285.966 - 9294.368: No, that's only 217. 9294.488 - 9295.128: It's only 215 million. 9310.812 - 9314.074:  We can also confirm that AMD has the same issue. 9335.869 - 9336.63: Yeah, it does. 9338.291 - 9339.512: Same issue, same problem. 9341.275 - 9341.455:  Okay. 9342.055 - 9344.657: It's using a large kernel and notice how there's no issues on this one. 9344.677 - 9344.897: Okay. 9345.417 - 9353.862: It's using a large kernel and this group ID seems to be too large. 9361.006 - 9362.467: See if we can find any docs about this. 9363.548 - 9364.829: If max group ID. 9375.996 - 9378.877:  Next thread, dims, max, grid size. 9389.823 - 9392.324: Is there like a, it's like CL info, but hip info? 9404.23 - 9404.93: Hip config. 9408.649 - 9409.01:  Full. 9412.033 - 9412.554: What useful. 9418.421 - 9419.122: Okay, here. 9422.026 - 9423.748: I'm going to get to the hip samples directory. 9423.768 - 9424.409: And of course, 9439.62 - 9445.684:  So, again, okay, it's possible it's this. 9446.245 - 9450.068: And if it turns out to be this, holy shit, you should have put in a cert, you know? 9450.088 - 9457.053: Like if you're building like a thing you want developers to use, you should put in a cert. 9465.779 - 9467.18: Okay, good hallucination, Grok. 9468.66 - 9469.841:  Doesn't seem to be real. 9482.288 - 9483.509: Does it show up in OpenCL? 9483.589 - 9484.129: I mean, maybe. 9484.149 - 9493.635: Is it the total levels that doesn't work? 9493.675 - 9494.996: Or is it just that one? 9502.262 - 9503.303:  It tells me that. 9503.323 - 9509.889: All right. 9511.09 - 9513.372: Maybe we should just try a simple test and see if we can make a family. 9540.515 - 9542.576:  I'll show you how this stuff works in the tiny grad runtime. 9543.356 - 9543.857: Kind of cool. 9544.657 - 9551.82: So we can just do from tiny grad runtime dot ops hip import hip device. 9553.761 - 9556.502: Hip program, we have a compiler here. 9556.522 - 9560.484: And the compiler. 9569.462 - 9570.763:  need to pass anything to heptomize. 9570.843 - 9572.485: I don't think so. 9572.505 - 9577.829: Hip program. 9577.849 - 9581.992: MD compiler. 9582.053 - 9583.714: I'm going to construct that. 9587.757 - 9588.017: Pile. 9599.622 - 9601.143:  And that program is very simple. 9601.163 - 9623.142: I have program needs to be made on the device. 9623.182 - 9623.822: We need to give it a name. 9628.23 - 9631.514:  And then we can do program call. 9631.534 - 9634.678: I want you to allocate fucking buffers. 9635.599 - 9646.791: And buffer and hip allocator. 9660.428 - 9688.485:  okay blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah 9692.871 - 9706.639:  Args global size equals that times that local size might already be the default, so I don't actually need that. 9731.062 - 9732.523:  I need to get an arch. 9744.609 - 9745.79: Doesn't know about achles. 9745.81 - 9747.231: I need to tell about achles. 9749.932 - 9751.333: There's not a bad achles. 9751.573 - 9752.433: I'm excited. 9754.274 - 9755.275: Fucking psyched, bro. 9759.658 - 9763.962:  No type size T. Oh, no. 9773.63 - 9775.211: The assert guy was on vacation. 9775.251 - 9776.612: Yeah, no, no, no, no. 9779.475 - 9780.336: That might be true. 9780.356 - 9780.916: Oh, what? 9783.378 - 9785.18: Only applies to kernel function. 9790.889 - 9792.269:  Be this craft tool. 9804.452 - 9807.452: Memory access privilege. 9807.472 - 9811.413: Should be a privilege. 9814.874 - 9816.854: Well, it doesn't look like a real thing, I don't know. 9831.513 - 9832.053:  All right, cool. 9837.878 - 9839.74: Oh, you really need to put that thing in no buy. 9839.76 - 9843.943: You know that shit. 9844.143 - 9844.804: You know the thing. 9845.885 - 9846.825: You know the thing. 9852.23 - 9852.95: I'm not gonna do it now. 9853.911 - 9854.432: Cause I'm lazy. 9867.998 - 9869.218:  Let's see how many ones it has. 9869.238 - 9872.78: Let's just kind of fill it with ones. 9877.961 - 9879.602: Oh, it's not even a buffer. 9881.623 - 9884.384: Oh, oh, boo, boo. 9885.904 - 9888.525: Boo, we're going to go to a higher level of abstraction. 9896.034 - 9897.431:  Raise the abstraction! 9922.582 - 9927.284:  I mean I could just do copy out, but then I get like none of this syntactic sugar, so whatever. 9927.304 - 9933.886: I'll throw some deep pop on this bitch. 9941.769 - 9943.95: You guys really get exposed to my inner monologue. 9946.051 - 9947.552: This is actually what it sounds like. 9947.572 - 9951.213: This is what I'm thinking, this is what I'm in my head with. 9971.889 - 9994.382:  All right, the fucking zeros zeros Well that one works that one don't work bad AMD bad AMD But what's crazier is that 9997.125 - 9998.786:  I mean, okay, let's actually make this. 9999.066 - 10002.049: I shouldn't have done it like this. 10002.129 - 10002.729: Device. 10002.769 - 10003.51: compiler. 10004.49 - 10006.032: How do I get the compiler from the device? 10007.413 - 10008.313: Get it as shit works. 10012.416 - 10013.537: I don't actually need that. 10013.617 - 10014.878: I can just get that from the device. 10014.898 - 10016.519: And then we can try it with the AMD backend. 10020.282 - 10020.962: You see the zeros? 10022.083 - 10022.984: Who sees the zeros? 10031.853 - 10032.973:  Leave all that shit. 10039.816 - 10040.196: That work. 10043.297 - 10044.677: The Vice doesn't have program. 10044.697 - 10046.558: You have to have no attribute program. 10048.859 - 10050.479: You didn't make your attribute program. 10057.962 - 10059.102: Do I give something like that? 10059.162 - 10060.383: God, I forgot how this shit works. 10060.403 - 10061.623: It's all called compiled. 10062.735 - 10065.777:  I really still call it compile runtime. 10069.641 - 10074.745: That, I can do like dev dot compiler. 10075.385 - 10078.328: That's not great. 10078.368 - 10080.449: Now I abstract away from, there we go. 10080.469 - 10081.75: We did a high-level abstraction. 10081.83 - 10082.871: I should have done that to begin with. 10083.372 - 10084.793: Damn, my abstracts are much better now. 10084.813 - 10085.593: Those are pretty good. 10085.613 - 10091.018: You have to hit program and it takes four positional arguments, but five were given, yeah, because don't give it the dev. 10099.782 - 10100.503:  Just good abstractions. 10101.023 - 10101.283: All right. 10102.764 - 10107.668: We have now reduced it to the minimum bullshit. 10110.009 - 10110.61: What is the name? 10111.17 - 10112.091: Can I get the name of the device? 10112.111 - 10112.771: I'm gonna get the name. 10113.612 - 10114.212: I'll get the buffer. 10114.232 - 10115.033: I don't want a buffer. 10115.053 - 10120.376: I was trying to name D now. 10121.897 - 10123.158: See if it behaves the same way. 10123.178 - 10124.439: Yo, hip. 10124.459 - 10125.28: This is not cool. 10129.372 - 10132.233:  There it is with AMD just faster because it doesn't use stupid help. 10135.274 - 10135.554: Hmm. 10137.434 - 10138.234: Interesting. 10139.555 - 10140.115: Look at that. 10142.036 - 10144.696: It hung for a long time and then printed that. 10145.216 - 10147.417: So it's like it's trying and then failing. 10157.68 - 10158.34: Interesting. 10160.473 - 10165.257:  I can also just use device default, and then I can just, whatever, but, okay. 10168.44 - 10170.862: And AMD bug, no way! 10170.962 - 10175.045: Couldn't be an AMD bug, no way, because AMD doesn't write bugs, okay. 10175.326 - 10176.687: How many zeros did we get? 10183.152 - 10184.954: How do I check that quickly and I'm pi? 10186.855 - 10188.437: Big minus one. 10190.029 - 10190.93:  non-zero. 10193.791 - 10195.872: So we can figure out exactly how many I got. 10195.892 - 10204.497: All right, it did exactly one megabyte of ones. 10206.698 - 10208.539: Can I do this all in one aqua group? 10210.66 - 10212.261: Let's try to get even simpler with this. 10215.343 - 10216.764: I'll also stuff the 10218.517 - 10219.837:  shader and see if there's anything stupid. 10219.917 - 10237.682: All right, don't do that. 10237.702 - 10239.842: Well, I can, but I can decompile. 10239.982 - 10241.362: I have a tool for that. 10241.382 - 10243.563: dev.compiler. 10244.083 - 10244.863: disassemble. 10244.883 - 10244.983: mbin. 10249.285 - 10250.786:  How nice of my abstractions, guys. 10250.806 - 10256.652: Okay. 10258.934 - 10260.335: So, what's bug? 10267.401 - 10270.424: Okay, let's also, let's first try something like this. 10284.5 - 10289.502:  I don't know, let's... Let me commit this. 10290.742 - 10294.604: I want the stupid LLVM branch, whatever. 10294.624 - 10311.83: Don't need any of that. 10312.951 - 10314.361:  Let's try something like... 10354.645 - 10355.686:  Okay, that worked. 10358.187 - 10359.888: What if I put it as a second one? 10380.139 - 10380.619: Interesting. 10383.928 - 10384.75:  valid argument. 10388.136 - 10389.058: It's a lot more reasonable. 10409.806 - 10412.347:  I mean, this is like very standard looking GPU code, right? 10412.707 - 10413.808: You guys know what this looks like. 10419.41 - 10424.372: Again, the killer thing that makes this whole thing unexcusable, this is definitely an AMD book, right? 10424.392 - 10425.673: There's no question about that now. 10427.834 - 10439.199: It's possible that if we actually query the thing that it tells you that the launch size can't be that big, but still put in a fuck in a syrup now. 10443.904 - 10447.967:  Because if I switch to the other GPU, this behaves correctly. 10448.888 - 10451.449: That's my ace in the hole. 10452.23 - 10455.332: I don't think I can be holding it wrong to get that behavior. 10460.976 - 10462.557: Let's make this smaller. 10462.577 - 10465.84: It shouldn't have to be this big. 10468.722 - 10469.802: So what if I just go 6, 5, 3, 3, 7? 10469.943 - 10470.563: Still broken? 10482.773 - 10483.814:  Correct on that one. 10485.295 - 10486.075: And correct on that one. 10486.095 - 10486.515: Okay, cool. 10488.877 - 10489.077: Yeah. 10489.537 - 10493.699: So this has a max size of six, five, three, three, six. 10495.28 - 10495.841: That's the bug. 10500.043 - 10502.745: I think if I flip these around, it's fine. 10502.765 - 10511.59: Yep, that's fine. 10515.649 - 10515.991:  Okay. 10518.221 - 10518.442: Great. 10554.373 - 10561.995:  All right, let's add shit to my driver to make it better than him. 10565.856 - 10569.277: Yeah, okay, actually, let's also see if this one matters at all. 10569.317 - 10571.358: So what if I just go to light for here? 10581.02 - 10582.041: Okay, that's also wrong. 10582.501 - 10583.501: What if I go to one here? 10587.203 - 10591.748:  If you're not allowed to put one as the first dimension, you might have complained last time. 10593.75 - 10594.25: No, yeah, good. 10594.711 - 10597.674: So there's your minimal failing example. 10600.196 - 10603.66: All right, I'm sure there's some stupid hip way to get this that we should be checking. 10617.683 - 10619.528:  Hip device prop T. 10655.544 - 10658.03:  Already getting the device properties 10683.568 - 10685.709:  Useless. 10692.873 - 10694.333: Oh, well, of course, that one. 10704.798 - 10706.119: Max grid size. 10753.203 - 10754.734:  Okay, that's it. 10850.372 - 10851.152:  All right, there you go. 10852.473 - 10853.413: So there's your max. 10864.998 - 10866.999: You know, I think this actually copies in the video. 10871.7 - 10872.301: Look at that. 10873.981 - 10877.843: This one also returns the same max, yet it works. 10879.903 - 10881.286:  Lot of questions, boys. 10881.567 - 10882.569: Lot of questions. 10915.783 - 10921.733:  So this one returns the same thing, but it works. 10949.55 - 10958.105:  You ready to get the name, right? 10959.087 - 10959.648: Is it the name? 10960.489 - 10961.251: I wonder how it works. 10982.642 - 10983.062:  That's AMD. 10983.182 - 10983.702: All right. 10992.364 - 10994.825: You know what, the fix for this? 10995.625 - 10999.286: We have a fix for this, I believe, because I believe I do it in Nvidia. 11001.967 - 11003.567: That's actually in a renderer, I think. 11025.793 - 11027.994:  All right, let's try the thing again. 11038.715 - 11039.496: Am I right answer now? 11047.797 - 11052.858: So they copied this feature from NVIDIA, and they made it actually work. 11053.598 - 11055.16:  Hello, how can I assist you today? 11055.18 - 11057.782: I can provide entertainment and bullshit. 11059.043 - 11060.465: It's pretty good actually on params. 11061.526 - 11062.487: The panel's actually good. 11066.31 - 11067.752: Okay, bug fixed. 11069.053 - 11073.978: All right, so it was not a compiler bug. 11076.881 - 11077.261: It was a... 11079.139 - 11084.761:  they silently changed the behavior of the locals max to actually be in forest. 11085.262 - 11093.725: Not like it was fine to query that info, but like two things about it were like very broken. 11093.745 - 11095.426: Hip should have asserted. 11096.946 - 11099.447: But then why does it work on the other one? 11100.308 - 11102.148: But actually, that's sick though. 11102.168 - 11105.49: This is a great, I mean, that's pretty amazing that it's getting more 11107.227 - 11109.048:  This is a 7900 XTX. 11114.83 - 11118.612: And this is the 700 XTX. 11118.652 - 11119.392: This is the new one. 11119.412 - 11120.753: And it's pretty amazing. 11120.793 - 11125.255: Again, in line with AMD having great hardware, I'm like, who wrote that software? 11126.295 - 11128.236: Who thought this wasn't like a good idea? 11130.817 - 11133.378: So this gets 72 tokens per second out of the box. 11133.398 - 11134.138: This gets 69. 11134.418 - 11135.419: Okay, let's beam them both. 11146.929 - 11147.349:  give them a minute. 11147.389 - 11149.37: They're going to search for the fastest kernels they can find. 11149.39 - 11152.23: I probably could have done jip beam, but it doesn't matter. 11152.25 - 11155.511: It's going to be really slow because of that. 11155.611 - 11156.191: No, it's fine. 11158.711 - 11161.432: It's the same way they loaded some with beads. 11179.025 - 11181.047:  Okay, I'll push this all upstream. 11183.709 - 11185.91: Okay, so with beam, we get it up to 78. 11186.03 - 11191.074: See, here's where that guy really shines. 11199.56 - 11199.9: Not of G0. 11199.98 - 11204.624: There's only differences which device I'm invisible. 11206.788 - 11210.113:  Okay, so our AMD back end works totally fine. 11231.671 - 11236.652:  I almost wonder, because NVIDIA's limitation is real, and NVIDIA actually has the asserts. 11241.013 - 11243.494: Yes, you see, it's faster on this one. 11244.334 - 11248.115: That's more like the disparity I would expect. 11250.836 - 11259.218: Yeah, it's a little slow, it's 100 XCX, but on the non-beamed thing, it's good. 11275.524 - 11276.685:  How do we feel about this? 11278.425 - 11284.108: We'll let non-subscribers talk, and let's have a discussion about how we feel about this bug. 11284.128 - 11296.534: I think it wasn't difficult to find where to query, but it's non-intuitive, and there should be an answer. 11300.436 - 11303.258: There's no certain AMD, to be fair, so it's not like 11307.614 - 11309.254:  It's a big mistake putting on subs a while. 11309.274 - 11310.435: They're going to derail me. 11311.415 - 11312.355: We're going to get derailed. 11312.435 - 11314.015: You have 10 minutes later, we're derailed. 11315.036 - 11319.956: 10 minutes, 10 minutes later, we're back to talking about why you want to have just gold. 11320.037 - 11325.538: You don't want to have a dual monetary coinage thing because anytime there's complexity, they're scamming. 11326.438 - 11328.958: Whenever they make things complex, oh, but you have to. 11329.198 - 11332.179: George really didn't study modern monetary theory. 11332.488 - 11334.508:  You guys are fucking CIA shills. 11335.309 - 11338.77: Well, there's not enough money in circulation to back it all by gold. 11339.03 - 11340.71: What are you even talking about? 11341.27 - 11343.071: Money in circulation? 11343.631 - 11345.031: What do you think that shit is? 11345.751 - 11351.012: Well, you see, there's not enough money in all the monopoly sets in all the world to back it by gold. 11351.873 - 11353.053: What are you talking about? 11353.173 - 11354.293: Just make it less gold. 11355.033 - 11356.094: That's the real shit. 11356.694 - 11360.075: Whatever, however much money there is, that's how much money you get in circulation. 11360.155 - 11361.415: Gold's just mispriced. 11370.604 - 11373.005:  Yeah, we're accusing people of being CIA shells. 11374.085 - 11375.605: Oh, because I'm a reverse idiot. 11375.765 - 11380.766: No, you guys, if you believe in the paper money, you are an idiot! 11381.287 - 11382.047: Or you're on the tank. 11382.807 - 11385.228: One of two things, you're either an idiot or on the tank. 11388.328 - 11390.269: We need chat to derail us. 11393.51 - 11395.25: No, no, but the dollars are worthless! 11395.803 - 11397.705:  Hey, bitch, I said the dollars are worthless. 11398.225 - 11400.367: It was backed by the whole threat of the US military. 11400.387 - 11403.489: If you don't say the dollars are valuable, bitch, I'm gonna shoot you in the head. 11406.972 - 11412.436: Yeah, I mean, we're explaining to them how the money is not real and that only gold is real money. 11414.999 - 11416.159: Yeah, no, it's okay. 11418.621 - 11420.703: How do you feel about the monetary crisis? 11422.144 - 11422.865: You know how I feel. 11425.003 - 11431.428:  You guys know that I actually like people think that she copies my ideas, but I actually just copy my ideas from her. 11431.448 - 11433.65: I copy my ideas from her. 11433.71 - 11435.271: My handler gives me my ideas. 11436.412 - 11438.213: What do I think about my monetary theory? 11438.914 - 11440.335: Modern monetary theory. 11440.375 - 11443.097: You see the velocity of money is really low. 11443.197 - 11446.539: Most money in US dollars doesn't move and just sits there. 11447.14 - 11448.08: That's a big problem. 11448.1 - 11448.761: Don't tell them that. 11449.306 - 11450.947:  should read a book called The Great Taking. 11451.007 - 11451.867: It'll blow your mind. 11452.308 - 11457.23: More people will get ideas about starting business when they pass the dollars back and forth to increase the cost of your money. 11457.31 - 11457.45: Oh, yes. 11457.49 - 11458.491: This is one of my favorites. 11458.511 - 11459.992: Have you told them about our new business? 11460.632 - 11461.713: She's going to start a business. 11462.253 - 11465.314: And he's going to start a business and we'll pay each other one dollar. 11465.494 - 11465.935: Yeah. 11466.155 - 11467.576: We'll work for each other. 11467.976 - 11471.358: Yeah, because it's, um, it's scalable software. 11471.878 - 11472.778: It's SaaS. 11473.339 - 11474.699: That means we get a 15 to 20 X markup. 11476.618 - 11477.279:  on our revenue. 11477.819 - 11479.52: And so we don't even need a markup. 11479.56 - 11480.881: We can have all the revenue we want. 11480.901 - 11484.124: We'll just pass the same dollar back and forth over and over again. 11484.284 - 11485.765: Same dollar back and forth. 11486.045 - 11487.527: Infinite revenue glitch. 11488.147 - 11488.788: Actually, no. 11488.908 - 11489.868: No, no, no. 11489.888 - 11490.649: Amanda, it's important. 11490.669 - 11491.95: We each have a multi-million dollar comp. 11492.11 - 11498.255: It's important that we have blockchain technology because if we were passing the dollar back and forth using wire transfers, it would take a long time. 11498.932 - 11501.374:  We need the dollars to go back and forth really fast. 11502.555 - 11504.256: The velocity of money. 11504.296 - 11505.497: We make them go fast enough. 11505.557 - 11510.081: Maybe it's like one of those glitches where it just pops up in both of our accounts frequently enough. 11510.882 - 11513.044: Yeah, yeah. 11513.124 - 11514.225: Talked out. 11514.265 - 11517.808: She knows about talked out. 11517.868 - 11519.989: No, we're going to get taxed for each transfer. 11520.77 - 11521.03: Yeah. 11521.43 - 11521.891: Wow. 11522.071 - 11524.553: We should go to a tax friendly jurisdiction. 11524.593 - 11526.855: Taxes are just lowering the velocity of money. 11527.195 - 11532.399:  Yeah, we should try to go to a tax-friendly jurisdiction for service much of this new wealth as we can. 11532.459 - 11533.159: That's a good point. 11534.16 - 11535.581: Yeah, tax optimization. 11535.601 - 11540.685: But yeah, that 15 to 20x multiple, we can both have big businesses. 11541.105 - 11542.266: Big business. 11542.886 - 11545.188: Think like Sam Altman size. 11545.308 - 11553.134: But you know how, you know how like, even if you get a really high venture valuation, you still can't like go to a bank and get a loan against it. 11553.675 - 11577.017:  like if my company gets valued by VCs as like a hundred million dollar company I can't say okay I own 30% of it and go get a loan from an actual bank for like 30 million dollars but they know it's you know what you could get a loan against what if you own a hundred million dollars of gold they give you a loan against that right um they would definitely like to have your gold that 11577.432 - 11579.533:  They would love to give you a loan against the gold. 11580.133 - 11580.594: Why? 11580.834 - 11581.694: Why is that? 11582.295 - 11584.656: In the 30s, they took everybody's gold. 11584.696 - 11586.917: Like, nobody even remembers this in the US. 11587.597 - 11591.92: I'm telling you that there's like the CIA or some intelligence agency. 11592.6 - 11593.48: They made it illegal. 11593.5 - 11594.481: Look up the US law. 11594.521 - 11598.763: There was illegal to own any gold because they made everyone bring in their jewelry. 11598.803 - 11600.444: They kind of bring in their jewelry. 11600.484 - 11604.186: I can't believe there's commenters who are shilling for not the gold standard. 11604.612 - 11605.593:  I don't understand. 11606.274 - 11608.356: You must work for intelligence agency. 11609.417 - 11610.979: It's hard to go back to the gold standard. 11611.279 - 11614.562: How do you...
